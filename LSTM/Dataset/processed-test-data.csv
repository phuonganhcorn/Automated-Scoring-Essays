4861,25,Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age. Some think they should begin at least 7 years old. Discuss both views give opinions,"The beginning of formal education in children is a major topic of concern in today's world. While some people believe that the children should learn the formal education during their early childhood, there are more reasonable grounds that it is better to start the formal learning at the minimum age of seven.
There is a common belief that the formal education had better be applied in children's lives at a very early age. This may be true since if children had an early approach to the formal learning, they would have a better initial academic points than the ones doing it later. This means the kids who begin the formal education well before attending schools would have less struggle with the academic lessons in class, therefore, the teachers could lessen their time on teaching the basic knowledge and go deeper in the more important lessons, which provides children with professional knowledge.
However, there are more convincing evidence that children should begin the formal education at least 7 years old. It is more considerable that adults should not constrain the young children to learn all the hard theory and knowledge which is out of the ability of a child. If children are forced to maintain that challenging learning throughout their childhood, they may face dozens of stress and pressure, which leads to the lack of joyful childhood. Thus, it would be better to let the children's minds unwind until they get 7, a perfect age when their brains are well-developed and suitable for higher education.
In conclusion, although there are a few reasons why children should start the formal education since they are little children, it is more persuasive that children ought to be at least 7 years old for formal learning. It is suggested that parents encourage their kids to learn soft skills such as communication and cooperation during children's early childhood.",0,"The beginning of formal education in children is a major topic of concern in today's world.

4242,17,"In some countries, small town-centre shops are going out of business because people tend to drive to large out-of-town stores. As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","Over the past decades, in many countries, small shops in the urban areas cannot compete with large stores located in the outskirts. As a consequence, the demand for cars witnesses an increase and access to huge out-of-town stores becomes limited for people who do not have cars. While this trend is beneficial to some extent, I would contend that its shortcomings are more significant.
On the one hand, the development of large suburban stores offers some advantages. One of these merits is that this tendency mitigates pressure on housing supply systems. When citizens change their shopping preference, they tend to move to out-of-town areas to live. As a result, it may decrease the demand for accommodation and address overpopulation in the urban areas. Therefore, this trend may relieve the housing supply burden. Furthermore, if large stores in the suburb improve, it can generate a variety of employment for the local people there. Hence, they can get rid of poverty and have better life conditions.
On the other hand, I believe that there are more considerable disadvantages to increasing bankrupt small-town shops. The first one is the inconvenience when citizens have to travel to a distant place for shopping. Moving a long distance takes a plethora of effort, time and fuel. Moreover, the tremendous number of shops going out of business can significantly damage the city's economy and also the national economy. The second one is the traffic congestion. The rise in car usage led to the enormous number of transports in the outskirts, as a consequence, traffic problems will frequently occur.
In conclusion, although the tendency toward shopping in the large stores situated in the suburbs is advantageous in a few ways, the drawbacks of this trend are serious to take into consideration. It is recommended that the government should promote citizens shopping in the shop close to where they live.",0,"Over the past decades, in many countries, small shops in the urban areas cannot compete with large stores located in the outskirts.

384,0,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The influence of hazardous sports is a major topic of concern in today's world. While some people maintain that these kinds of activities should be abandoned by governments, there is still a belief that individuals should be free to indulge themselves in any activity or sports.
There are some common reasons why extreme sports should be forbidden. One of the most dominant reasons is that participating in those activities can be accompanied by a high chance of serious injury or death. In rock climbing, for example, there were some fatal accidents due to the catastrophic equipment failure, the unforecastable severe weather condition, or attempt to experience risky routs. Another considerable reason is that barbaric sporting matches such as boxing and martial arts mostly represent violence which might affect adversely young spectators. The fact that athletes fighting fiercely to knock out their opponents may induce adolescents to be more aggressive and solve conflicts by violence in their real lives as a consequence of imitating sportsmen's behaviors.
However, there is stronger evidence that people should be given the liberty to do every activity and sports they have passion for. It is obvious that playing challenging sports allows athletes to gain invigorating experiences such as diving under the sea and standing on the top of a majestic mountain, which may be an effective way to release stress. In contrast, limiting the range of sports permitted to play can make people feel trapped and constrained. Moreover, engaging in such sports might develop a person's valuable personality traits. This stems from rigorous training requiring incredible effort and endurance every athlete must overcome. As a result, these experiences may shape their brave, patience as well as high emotional stability in sudden changes or risky situations in their life.

While some people believe that children should be provided with education before they are 7 years old, some individuals advocate that later education brings more benefits for children. From my perspective, I believe that each form of education has its own advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand, there are several reasons to explain why children should receive education at an early age. To begin with, receiving an early formal education will help students to become smarter. As younger children have better memories and learning ability than the older one, it is easier for them to acquire knowledge and information. Besides, entering school at a young age will provide children opportunities to explore themselves and figure out their natural talents. Teachers provide students exercises and work to find out their talents in many fields and improve them. Take Vietnamese students for example, those students are sent to school at a very early age and get involved in academic classes even if they are under 7 years old. After a couple of months, those children will be cared for by teachers with the aim to become specialized students.
On the other hand, some individuals prefer later education as it brings many outcomes.

Children could be taught some necessary skills by their parents when they were born and participate in activities for children.

Moreover, spending time doing housework and learning skills with parents rather than studying could help the relationship between them and their parents become more tight-knit.

This way also has been argued to have a downside like diminishing the time for humans to meet their friends. Nonetheless, in my belief, I might disapprove of the mentioned idea and below is an essay clarifying my view point.
To begin with, this kind of socializing helps people save time. Human beings have been busy with a pill of work recently, since they have not had an opportunity to meet their fellows face-to-face but for cyber conservation. Hence, instead of arranging an appointment, choosing an ideal place and having commuting time, everyone presumably prefers video meetings.

Due to a number of advanced devices which support video call features, people can see their friends or relatives, despite being in different regions. Besides, this type of maintaining connection leads communities to be more close-knit with each other. To be more specific, during quarantine time in my country, there has been an application program called "" Zalo connecting "" that depicts numerous locations where residents are in need.

1317,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Cycling has been known as an environmentally friendly and healthy activity so far but this means of transport is gradually used less in modern life. This action can be ascribed to a few reasons, and thus some remedies should be implemented to increase the use of bicycles.
The development of the world has caused the reduction in the use of slow modes of transport such as the bicycle. Firstly, there are many fast and convenient vehicles, such as motorbike or car, which are significantly better than bicycles in the world nowadays. It is because these means of transport do not need a lot of physical strength to operate and the operators are less affected by weather or exterior factors. Furthermore, the scarcity of cycling paths also contributes to the remarkable decline of bicycle use. For example, in some less-developed countries in Southeast Asia, cyclists have to share the same lane with cars, which may pose a threat to their safety.
A number of measures should be adopted to encourage people to use bicycles to commute more. The government can restrict the number of cars or motorbikes that each family can own and impose higher taxes in fossil fuel vehicles, and as a result, they may alleviate the detrimental pollution of the environment. In addition, investing money in constructing cycling lanes would create more suitable space for the cyclists to comfortably travel on the road. Therefore, people may tend to go to work and do exercises more by bicycle to improve their health.

3036,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"Due to the research of many companies, they realize that a lot of new workers do not have soft skills, for example cooperative skills. This is an alarming problem as it causes competition or they are being uninterested by the boss. It must be addressed by proper activities and training to connect the new employees with ex-employee.
There are several reasons why those problems are happening. One of the most common reasons is the competition. The employee always wants to have a good look in the owner's eye. As a result, they are jealous and fight with each other to take all the benefits for themselves. A good example of this would be the income and getting hurt others by debate for more extra-pay. Furthermore, some bosses are just care about the irrespective of business trends of the company to increase the finance and the money and do not care about the connection between workers, so that they have various roles in the company with no link and no contact.
A number of measures could be adopted to minimize the distance of employees. First of all, the leaders have to understand and making more activities for them such as playing soccer matches together. Additionally, the head of business should have a course of teamwork skills for the workers to prepare and know their partners deeply.
In short, the lack of basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill may spring from the competition and the disinterest.

While this trend is advantageous in a few ways, I believe that the drawbacks are far weightier.
On the one hand, there are some benefits of taking a trip to isolated areas. First of all, undertaking expeditions to remote natural regions can give people some remarkable experience. Since traveling to other cities or countries has been too familiar, exploring remote natural areas will become an option worth considering. Travelers may have a chance to unwind and broaden their horizons if they choose this travel form. Furthermore, scientists can take advantage of this type to analyze some scientific data such as ice thickness. Such studies will help governments to develop appropriate plans, dealing with many environmental problems.
The benefits, however, are dwarfed by substantial disadvantages. The primary is that traveling to isolated regions may be risky if travelers are not well-prepared. For example, they may get into trouble with the temperature in the South Pole, which harms their health, or those travelers may face the danger of being victims of wild animals attacks. Therefore, this type of traveling often requires a large amount of investment for research and ensuring security. As a result, the budget to carry out these trips is likely to be quite costly, and only scientists or those with high income can afford this cost.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that the pervasive usage of modern devices can impede the development of essential skills, such as reading and writing. The first reason is that children usually abbreviate their words when messaging with their friends. With the advancement of cutting-edge applications, such as Grammarly, every wrong word can be corrected by this supporting technology; thus, children will become overdependent on their phones and hence gradually harm their writing skills without any consciousness. Secondly, youngsters spend too much time on digital entertainment, such as social media, video games; therefore, it is extremely difficult for them to allocate their leisure time for reading or writing activities. As a result, not only would they get addicted to these harmful recreations but also suffer from a deficiency of significant skills for their further careers.
On the other hand, I would argue that smartphones and computers contribute to the improvements of their basic skills, including writing and reading. Firstly, the Internet contains unlimited sources of information, which youngsters can get access to and apply to their essays. For this reason, these precious documents, which they can hardly be taught in schools, will diversify the quality of their writing styles and outperform their peers. Another reason is that the young can develop their writing levels by creating their own blogs in which they can express their feelings through words. To illustrate, as generation Z has a strong desire to show their ego, more and more young people design their own blogs as a way to fulfill their ambition. Therefore, these online pages will push them to read and write every day and hence make steady progress in these skills.

419,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In contemporary times, the reduction of bicycle use rates regardless of its benefits has been one of the ongoing topics of concern in societies. which stem from the people's demand for a fast vehicle The demand of faster vehicles as well as the physical conditions required to ride a bike are known to be one of the main culprits of this problem, which can be alleviated by raising car taxes and widely promoting the perks of cycling to the public.
The reduction in the use rates of bicycles derives from two main causes. Due to the need of travelling further distances in a shorter amount of time, inventions of faster means of transport such as cars, trains or motorbikes have been introduced, which has been widely used as these vehicles met their requirements of a speedy means of transport. Moreover, as it can be exhausting to ride a bicycle for a long period of time, strength and endurance, which many people do not possess, is needed. This also results in a greater predilection of the general public to engined vehicles.
In order to tackle these problems, several key measures can be taken into consideration. The government can impose new taxes on private vehicles and raise the cost of fuels, and simultaneously allocate more resources to the production of bicycles as well as establishing new lanes solely for cyclists. Not only will this help to encourage people to cycle more often, but also reduce the price of bicycles on the market and make it safer for cyclists to ride in populous regions, where the streets are extremely busy and hustle. Riding a bike can also improve one's health significantly, as it is a form of cardio and might help to reduce the rates of having age-related illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension. By using the media to propagandize the public about these benefits as well as the negative impact of cars on the environment, people can be encouraged to take up cycling more often.

In my opinion, the main reason why people think go to other countries to find a job or to study. Because nowaday, many nationals in the world are becoming the developed nationals. It has more advantages to live in this places. So many people are living in the developing nationals like Vietnam... alway want to go to the developed countries to deveplop their talent in study or get a nice job with a high salary. Sometimes if you live in other contries, you can do anything you like, you can live in the modern cities and it has more benefit for your life than in our contries. On the other hand, some disavantages are listed by some people don't like to go to other contries. Because if we go to other countries we will have to facing with the racist, sometime we can't live comfortable in some countries like China. Because in this region, the goverment is very evil and the local people are still conservative like the Chinese in the past. So the foreigns alway feel uncomfortable and it is very difficult to live in this region. To sum up, I still think the advantages of this outweigh the disavantages. Because when we go to other countries, we not just find a job or study that we can have a integration about the culturals in the world.",1522,307,14,4.055374592833876,62,61,28,44,13
4772,5,"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people store knowledge on the internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","With the unimaginable developments of technology, more and more people are likely to save their knowledge on the Internet instead of in books like in the past. From my point of view, although this tendency consists of several risky drawbacks compared to books, its benefits in our modern society totally overwhelm its downside.
On the one hand, it is undeniable that there are a wide range of advantages brought by the Internet to the storage of knowledge, outstanding those by books. First and foremost, knowledge uploaded to the Internet can be approachable for people in various parts of the world. To illustrate, people can easily get access to the information they need just through several clicks or searches on Google, compared to going to a bookstore or a library to look for a particular book. As a result, the Internet proves to be an accessible method of saving documents or knowledge, which can spread these useful sources to almost every corner of the world. Furthermore, it is both cost-effective and convenient to store knowledge on the Internet thanks to rapid technological improvements. For example, people can make full use of Google Drive to receive 15 gigabytes for storing documents without any fees, which can handle the amount of knowledge saved in dozens of books. Meanwhile, using books to save information not only takes an amount of money for printing, but also forces people to bring heavy books in their backpacks rather than a small laptop whenever they go out for work.
On the other hand, using books to store information or knowledge is far more secure than taking advantage of the Internet. For starters, there is always a possibility of losing stored knowledge or information on the Internet. For instance, when people accidentally click on infected-virus websites by cyber-attackers, all of their online data or information can be completely deleted while crucial documents could be stolen by hackers, which is truly dangerous. Therefore, the Internet is not evidently the safest approach for the storage of knowledge. Otherwise, it is easier to maintain the quality of books over long periods of time as well as protect them from being lost or stolen. People can manage to store books in a safe location in their houses to both simultaneously protect their books from adverse weather conditions or insects and prevent them from being stolen by other people. Hence, storing knowledge in books is supposed to be much safer than on an Internet platform.
In conclusion, although there are possible security concerns associated with storing knowledge on the Internet, this potential approach is much more approachable, convenient, and economical than saving in traditional books.",0,"With the unimaginable developments of technology, more and more people are likely to save their knowledge on the Internet instead of in books like in the past.

Consequently, the price they need to pay for the insurance is inordinate. Therefore, it seems like only scientists and rich people can afford this activity, so this development is likely to benefit only a small group of individuals. Besides, the tradeoffs of traveling to faraway lands are environmental and cultural assimilation.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","It is widely recognized that in certain parts of the world, large shopping malls on the outskirts prevail over small city-centre stores, which might cause a hinderance in accessibility for non-car owners and a growth in automobile usage. This trend, albeit somewhat beneficial, is associated with far more glaring drawbacks.
Granted, the merits of driving to shopping centers outside the city instead of local stores are evident. One key advantage is that this could create more employment opportunities in the automobile industry for citizens in the location of these malls. In other words, the heavier personal car usage would result in increasing demand for car manufacturing and maintaining, which would proliferate job vacancies in this sector for people living in nearby areas. As a result, this enormous job market not only defuses the unemployment crisis but also contributes to the development of the local economy.
However, the aforementioned benefit pales in comparison with the serious shortcomings attached with driving to suburban shopping center instead of going to the nearby small shops. One of the main disadvantages is that rising car usage would worsen the existing congestion. Because stores become more unreachable by foot or bicycle, people might own personal automobiles to get to far away shopping centers, which might lead to heavier traffic volume. It is exacerbated by the fact that the closure of local stores could cause difficulty for customers when they have a sudden need for purchase. Urban people now might be unable to shop at nearby convenience stores which used to be omnipresent in town centers, and instead they have to spend time travelling to the outskirts to go shopping.
In conclusion, although there are justifications for the dominance of suburban malls over town-centre small stores, I am of the belief that the drawbacks of this are far weightier.

So now, it is possible for everyone like tourists and scientists to travel to remote natural environment. The more roads are built, the more easily people can approach to these places. It has both advantages and disadvantages, but personally, i strongly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
Now, i firstly want to talk about the advantages of this. There are lost of beautiful views around the world from the valleys, the oceans to the mountains, such as Everest-the highest mountain in the world or Pyramid of Pharaoh-located in Africa. People can enjoy the beauty of the creation of previous people who lived thousands years ago.

Moreover, when scientists travel to these destinations, they can analysis and study from the old things and rare animals. And then, their knowledge would be broaden from their studies. At last, if the information is useful, it will be extend to the education of the world. My final opinion is the relaxation when traveling to these places make humans happier. In society today, many people are under a lots of pressure which make them tired. They have to try day by day to earn money form their work, so they need to relax. That is the reason why tourist economy is developing each bit of time. For example, after a long working season, people tend to travel to relax which is worth for their efforts. So after a long trip, they will have more energy to start working.
However, there are still some disadvantages of this. Many tourists traveling to a destination can change its ecosystem, whereas we believe or not, human is the main reason for the extinction of many animal.

While some people believe that the government these sports, there are more persuasive reasons why people should be free to choose any activities they want to play.
On the one hand, there are few reasons to believe that hazardous sports should be prohibited. the primary reason is that those activities are usually associated with injuries or even deaths. When participating in those activities, players often tense up to cope with strong sensations, so they easily have to experience muscle strain, which can cause back pain, acute neck pain. Another reason is that some extreme sports can lead to negative behaviour of a person as they like the strong and violent feeling that these sports represent.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that each person has the right to take up any sports or activities.

While some people believe that the government these sports, there are more persuasive reasons why people should be free to choose any activities they want to play. On the one hand, there are few reasons to believe that hazardous sports should be prohibited. the primary reason is that those activities are usually associated with injuries or even deaths. When participating in those activities, players often tense up to cope with strong sensations, so they easily have to experience muscle strain, which can cause back pain, acute neck pain. Another reason is that some extreme sports can lead to negative behaviour of a person as they like the strong and violent feeling that these sports represent. On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that each person has the right to take up any sports or activities.

3087,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"Interpersonal skill plays an active role in business that almost all new employees have lacked. This could be caused by several reasons including intrinsic and extrinsic factors, however there are solutions being suggested in order to improve basic skills of employees.
Lacking basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill might stem from intrinsic and extrinsic factors. New employees who are mentally difficult to get along with colleagues, tend to work independently rather than work with groups. This accidently creates a problem for individuals to co-operate with others in working that worsen business cohesion. Another reason comes from an extrinsic factor, when the working environment exerts a negative effect on employees. Almost all new workers who are suffering from heavy pressure working conditions find themselves unable to co-operate with other colleagues and superiors, because of the fear of wrong psychology. That means there is an unnecessary hesitation in those employees so that instead of associating with a group, they choose isolation.
A number of solutions could be adopted to tackle the problem associated with lack of interpersonal skills. Individual preference is hardly to be changed, so practical training workshops are expected to encourage new staff to be more co-operative. Practical experience provides new people with different approaches to work that might boost human companionship which underlie much of co-operation in working, besides broadening horizons. Moreover, a working environment is crucial for the cohesion of a group, therefore businesses should build a well-constructed condition where employees can work pleasurably. That means this environment also acts as a stimulus for people to improve their skills, communicate and work with each other.

Discuss both views give opinions,"The age of children when taking the official education is a major topic of concern today. While some claimed that it would be better to allow kids to attend elementary schools when they are at least 7 years old, there are more significant reasons why children could have formal education earlier.
There is a common belief that the minimum age of elementary education for children is 7. From parents' perspective, they do not want their children to be put under pressure of study at a very early stage of life. At this stage, the basic need for the children is an innocent and carefree childhood. In Vietnam, for example, when experiencing primary school, pupils have to immerse in intensive studying programs that those students devote almost their time for so that might cause some negative impacts on their psychology and physical health. From the educational researcher's perspective, when turning 7 years old, kids have significant mental and physical development, which are available for managing their study at school well. They are, as a result, more likely to achieve the best school performance.
However, the appropriate time for kids to go to school is when they turn 6 years old. The convincing reason for that is children have started their formal education at this age and gained success without any difficulties. According to some scientific evidences, brain development is enough to do the fundamental calculations and certain educational activities. In addition, the more young are the kids, the more quickly the knowledge is expanded. The time for remembering the vocabulary of the 6-years-old kid, for instance, is twice as fast as the older ones that is indicated in some brain research.

On the other hand, if people spend more time connecting to modern forms, they will be reduced time for family and friends. For example, thanks to technology, they can attach to their friends without meeting them in person, this can alienate the friendship, or they will become withdrawn because they don't have to go out to meet people to still be able to communicate.

I hold the view that its disadvantages overshadow the advantages.
On the one hand, traveling to remote natural habitat is is advantageous to scientists and tourists in a few aspects. In terms of scientists, they can have chances to do many researches since they find more and more new environments. For instance, they come across the tree which they have never seen before when they travel to an island having no survivals, resulting in that tree is the subject for them to clearly have an understanding with the island. To the tourists, it can help them broadening and remembering their knowlege of the nature. Seeing by the naked eyes is much more vividly than seeing through the telvevision or the newspaper, hence, people will rarely forget about what they learn from their journeys.
On the other hand, the downsides are serious, far outweighing the merits. This is firsly because it can be danger for people who do not get use to living in the natural environment, espeacially the large number of city dwellers. Traveling to the remote nature means people sometimes have to deal with strange animals, leading to they can easily be threaten by them or even be injured if they accidently cause harm to them. Another reason is that people can destroy the natural condition of these areas as they will be famous on the Internet once numerous people travel to. For example, some tourists who are unaware of protecting the orginal of environment pluck some flowers for fun or even litter where they enjoy the trip, so that part of the area will be spoiled.
In summary, scientists and tourists travel to remote natural environment is associated with many shortcomings which far exceed the benefits.

On the one hand, an increase in the number of car users offers people several benefits. One of the main advantages is having a dynamic economy.

The car enterprises growth creat conditions for persons to secure jobs, thus remarkably improve their living standard. Hence, it has a considerable part in national budget growing. In addition, a rise in car users reflects not only the development econimics but also the progress of society in some aspects such as the industrialization and modernizization process.
On the other hand, the high ratio of using cars is asociated with some drawbacks, which far outweigh the benefits. That many cars appears on the streets increase traffic flow, particularly in city centres. In commuting times, especially in off-peak times, traffic jams inevitably form on every street corners.

Another issue facing citizens is that the cost of living is much higher than that in the rural area for accommodation, transport, food,... Moreover, overpopulation in the city also leads to higher criminal rate in daily life.
To tackle these problems, the government should take action immediately. Firstly, they should rerange the transport system and encourage people to use more public transport. Secondly, government should invest the money in social housing to reduce the cost of living. The third measure is to develop provincial towns and rural areas by moving industry and better jobs to those regions.

While the released prisoners offer a few ways to educate students against delinquency, there is compelling evidence that other measures taken by policemen, parents and teachers are better.
On the one hand, there might be some certain reasons why ex-prisoners are associated with a few positive effects on educating students to stay away from illegal behavior. This is primarily because the released prisoners have witnessed the tough life in the jail in order that they can tell young people about how they became involve in crime, the danger of criminal lifestyle and what life in the prison is really like.

The purpose of this essay is to analyze both sides of the argument and then I will give my own perspective.
On the one hand, there are some reasons to believe that the authorities have the responsibility to ban and restrict extreme sports. The primary reason is that people would get serious injury or even death when playing these sports. A mountaineer, for instance, might fall even when he or she wears climbing equipment. In addition, watching dangerous sports such as boxing and car racing that represent violence can encourage aggressive behavior in the audience, especially the youth. They are a group of people that are easily psychologically affected by watching those types of sports and it can lead to illegal activities.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that each person has the freedom to take part in any sport activities they desire. This is mainly because playing a kind of sport is a matter of personal preference. In other words, when people want to challenge themselves, their options should be respected rather than forbidden by the law. Moreover, these extreme sports have been developed into a major market, creating many job opportunities.

The prize which can come up to millions of dollars from the championship attracts players from many countries come to compete.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","Shopping has become a dispensable need of every person. Throughout the years, shopping patterns have been significantly changing, from the appearance of small shops in the centre to the shopping centres in the suburbs. However, people with good economic conditions, particularly own cars, have the tendency to go to suburban malls. Therefore, the lack of access to out-of-town stores may lead to higher car use. While this trend exerts positive impatcs, it is the shortcomings that are more significant.
To begin with, shopping in large out-of-town stores is of great benefit to the consumer. It provides a variety of products and prices, suitable for many shoppers. Understanding the needs of families is to take their children out for the weekend, large shopping centres in suburbans also offer many other services such as restaurants, cinemas... to enhance the customer's shopping experience. When people feel satisfied with the service provided, they will spend more money and that creates favourable conditions for the seller to make a profit. Another important advantage is that large commercial centers will create jobs for people in the suburbs, where the working conditions are not as many as in the city. As a result, it will improve the local people's quality of life to some extent.
Nevertheless, the construction of shopping malls in the suburbs exerts negative impacts on people who do not have cars. They won't have many options when they have to shop in the small stores in the centre. They also have to pay some money to move there, for example renting a private car and gas filling. For those having private car, a large number of vehicles going to the outskirts will cause serious congestion, especially on weekends or holidays. This also causes a large number of emissions into the air when there are many long-distance vehicles, which leads to air quality deterioration in the suburbs and may cause respiratory problems.

1135,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Over the past few decades, in spite of being considered a zero-emission means of transport, road cycling has considerably lost its appeal to the general public. This practice acts as a catalyst for hazardous accidents associated with riding bicycles and overreliance on motor vehicles. It must be ameliorated by some effective remedies which include enhancing cycling infrastructure and imposing higher sales tax on motorized transports.
There are several reasons for a decline in the popularity of these human-powered vehicles. First and foremost, compared to other commuters, bike riders are more vulnerable to fall victim to traffic accidents which is the main culprit of severe traumas or even fatalities. Due to the bike's relatively small size, for instance, cycling entails a risk of getting into the blind sport of trucks and being involved in head-on collisions. In addition to this, riding a bike is inherently more dangerous than sitting inside a car frame with added protection from seatbelts and airbags. Another commonly cited reason is that, unlike motorbikes or cars, bicycles are considered to be highly physically demanding; hence, it is less suited for people with limited fitness level, especially when it comes to travelling long distance. This, as a result, discourages people from using a bike and causes them to switch to more convenient means of transport.
A number of measures could be adopted to motivate people to cycle more. On a national scale, the government should consider imposing higher parking fees on motorized transports. These financial resources, as a result, can be allocated to dedicated paths for cycling which mitigate the threats of accidents. Admittedly, if the infrastructure of cycling paths is well-designed, commuters can believe that riding a bike is safer and faster as then cyclists do not have to share the same lanes with other means of transport.
In conclusion, the declining popularity of bicycles can be attributed to high risks of accidents and overdependence on motor vehicles, which can be alleviated by some comprehensive solution including building exclusive lanes for cyclists and levying higher taxes on non-eco-friendly transports. It is predicted that unless these solutions are adopted, the world will still suffer from the issues related to air pollution.",0,"Over the past few decades, in spite of being considered a zero-emission means of transport, road cycling has considerably lost its appeal to the general public.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Extreme sports are becoming more prevalent as an increasing number of people commence doing them. Although there are some benefits for players to getting involved in risky sports, it is better to prohibit them.
On the one hand, the option to give people consent to play any sport is supported for several reasons. The primary reason is that residents should have the autonomy to participate in what kind of sport they prefer. The government should respect citizens' decisions and enable them to do what they desire, provided it is legal. Another reason could be that people who perform high-risk activities could improve their well-being. As people are inclined to lead a sedentary lifestyle, playing dangerous sports is also a method to engage in physical activities. As a result, such participants could be able to maintain their fitness and stay healthy, as well as reduce stress and depression.

9,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In today's modern world, bicycles are less being used as a transportation. This problem can be ascribed to the replacement of advanced vehicles such as motorbikes or cars. A number of measures should be taken to increase the use of bicycles, which include the government improving infrastructure to give bicycle users safer conditions and motivating people using bikes to protect the environment.
The primary reason why people are less interested in using bicycles is because they are witnessed the rapid developments of modern vehicles. Bicycles are gradually being replaced by cars and motorbikes, which are extremely common in many countries. People believe that these transportations are much more effective than bicycles as they are fast, less time-consumed and less energy-consumed. Furthermore, they have a high flexibility to help people performing any daily activities without taking too much of their time. To illustrate, cars are the main vehicles in many developed countries, or in Vietnam, people are using motorbikes almost everyday and cars are more and more popular as the country evolve. Therefore, with these factors, advanced transportations are considered to be the better option for many people, compared to bicycles.
A number of solutions should be adopted to inspire people using bicycles more and more. One action is that the governments should consider changing the infrastructure to be more suitable for using bicycles. This can be done by reconstruct the roads, build parks and areas for bicycle user, therefore they can feel safer and more comfortable to use bikes as their transportation daily. Another action is that to deal with the excessive use of cars and motorbikes, the problems of environment pollution should be shown. By this way, people can be more acknowledge about global warming, climate changes, pollution and be more aware in using private vehicles. As a result, they will be encouraged to use bicycles more regularly as a method to protect the environment. To be specific, in many European countries, residents are more and more interested in using bikes because the government invested a huge amount of money to increased traffic safety, improved infrastructure and shown people the benefits of using bicycles towards the environment.
Overall, the appears of modern vehicles is the main culprit to the decrease in the use of bicycles, which can be tackled by definite solutions such as reconstruct the cities reasonably and raise awareness among people about the environment. It is predicted that people are likely to use bicycles more in the future on the basis that they can now understand the negative impact of environmental issues like pollutions or climate changes.",0,"In today's modern world, bicycles are less being used as a transportation.

However, there are a number of people think that this development can have an adverse effect because of the reduction of time to meet their friends.

First of all, communication tools such as email or messaging help people to keep in touch with their family members and friends from a far distance.

2445,4,Some people think that increasing communication usage of computers and mobile phones by young people has had a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"A major topic of concern in modern society is whether the upward trend of youngsters to use computing devices, including smartphones, to socialize may hurt their abilities to read and write. It can be argued that this statement is totally wrong, since an increase in usage of telecommunications can even make young people's reading and writing skills better, and with a connected computer, young people nowadays can learn from their peers and senior people in composing their own essays and critical reading of others' writings.
The primary reason for this is that the growth in use of computing devices by the youth to socialize has done more good than ill to their literacy skills. Through social networking sites, for example Facebook and Twitter, young people are empowered to share the articles that they like from the New York Times or Time magazine, for instance, to their friends and followers, that can increase their reading skills, and even expository writing skills, since the Times has a learning network section which covers those basic literacy skills for young students. Moreover, emails, Gmail for example, force youngsters to write even more electronic letters and help boost their rhetorical ability.
Another important reason is that with a computing device connected to the Internet, young students these days are given a chance to study from their online friends and teachers in developing their basic literacy skills. When young people use their computers or mobile phones with an internet connection to learn online, for example on Coursera and Udacity, they are required to write their own English essays as homework assignments, and even grade their peers' writings, which help improve their writing and reading abilities, and even critical thinking, respectively. In addition to this, when youngsters go to work, especially in research, they are even encouraged to ask for help from senior people to revise their paper writing via email and phone calls, which help make their crafting skill even better. They can even collaborate on writing scientific papers on the Web, using platforms like Overleaf.
In conclusion, there are persuasive reasons why the rise in using laptops and cellphones to communicate by the youth has not hurt their literacy, such as the connected laptops, in reverse, improve the youth's literacy skills, and they are living in an enabling environment where they can get feedbacks from their friends and advisors in writing their own papers and reading other's pieces of writing. It is recommended that the surge in the use of computers and cells in digital telecommunications by the youth will keep having positive effects on their academic writing and reading skills in the near future.",0,"A major topic of concern in modern society is whether the upward trend of youngsters to use computing devices, including smartphones, to socialize may hurt their abilities to read and write. It can be argued that this statement is totally wrong, since an increase in usage of telecommunications can even make young people's reading and writing skills better, and with a connected computer, young people nowadays can learn from their peers and senior people in composing their own essays and critical reading of others' writings. The primary reason for this is that the growth in use of computing devices by the youth to socialize has done more good than ill to their literacy skills. Through social networking sites, for example Facebook and Twitter, young people are empowered to share the articles that they like from the New York Times or Time magazine, for instance, to their friends and followers, that can increase their reading skills, and even expository writing skills, since the Times has a learning network section which covers those basic literacy skills for young students.

4260,4,Some people think that increasing communication usage of computers and mobile phones by young people has had a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is a common belief that the tendency of using digital technologies is bringing significant drawbacks to young generations in the reading and writing aspects. In my opinion, I completely agree with this view for several reasons.
The first argument given to support my opinion is that overly having conversations through the Internet, youngsters may suffer from formal language deficits. Since computers and mobile phones users are mainly exposed to low-quality contents on social media, people may only interact with each other using absurd words which are overused on those sites. For example, shortening words used on text messages often lead to misunderstandings as they are poorly expressed. Moreover, these words mostly focus on serving entertaining purposes and do not require advanced literacy skills. This results in higher chances of teenagers losing their ability to read professional articles or learning materials.
Another rationale behind my belief is that most adolescents do not take time to interact with classic literature while they are attracted to modern devices. In fact, rather than reading books in pastimes, a lot of young people choose to chat with their friends on portable devices. However, traditional books are supposed to be great sources of knowledge as they bring a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical points to readers. And by lacking the reading habit, the loss of reading and writing proficiency or interest in the youths is resulted over time. Furthermore, when it comes to students, they are more likely to show their inability to write well and perform badly on academic tests.

1454,21,Some people think that advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Advertisement usually plays an important role in product consumption, because it is the best way to sell products quickly. However, advertisements focused on children as the main consumers are too many, so the government should introduce a law to prohibit all of them.
There are several reasons why commercials aimed for children should be eradicated. The primary reason is that children indirectly become the one who decrease family's economic condition. Since children do not have their own money and they have to depend on adults, all of the things such as toys and school supplies are all paid by their parents. After seeing the advertisement, children will ask their parents to buy for them, not because they need to, mainly because the goods in the advertisement are beautiful. As a result, the money paid for unnecessary products rises, which leads to less money for other important things.
Another reason for applying the children's advertisement ban is that it can result in the children's poor physical health and personality. This is primarily because a fascinating advert can take children's attention away from eating, hence decreasing their appetite and overall enjoyment with food. In addition, if children are addicted to watching adverts on Tv or other modern devices, they can easily have problems such as eyesore and obesity, as they only see the screen without going outside and doing exercise. Moreover, children would feel less appreciative of their own possessions as a consequence of watching too much new advertisements. When their parents do not have enough money to buy goods, especially toys which are promoted largely on many means of entertainment including social media, children would easily get cross, and beg their parents to buy more even though they have a large number of toys.
In conclusion, there should be a prohibition of advertisement for children, because of the family's financial budget, unhealthy lifestyle and bad characteristics of the children themselves. It is predicted that unless any action is adopted, parents will suffer from children with such problems in the future.",0,"Advertisement usually plays an important role in product consumption, because it is the best way to sell products quickly.

What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"In today's society, interpersonal skills are an essential talent to get a job. However, several companies have found that their new workers often lack such fundamental abilities in recent years. This problem can be caused by a variety of factors, all of which must be solved to encourage people to develop their interpersonal communication abilities.
The number of persons who have poor communication skills is increasing for a variety of reasons. The first is that during their school days, students have few chances to improve their presentation abilities. Furthermore, there are students today who just focus on their marks, they are uninterested in presentations or group projects. After that, this has resulted in a lack of basic interpersonal skills. Moreover, this problem is also based on a person's attitude, some individuals are constantly open to talking to others, while the majority of people are shy and afraid of not connecting with others, which will reduce their ability to communicate on a regular basis and gradually separate themselves from others.
On the other hand, some solutions should be done to boost the number of people who lack basic interpersonal skills. The first and also the best solution is to change the way students learn and are taught at school. Regular lessons should be replaced by ones that require students to make presentations or collaborate in groups. Furthermore, the school may create activities and competitions for the school community, improving students' collaboration and networking skills while they are still kids. Not only that, but businesses should provide some common place where workers may engage with others, reducing the amount of time spent working alone in a separate room. Furthermore, the government should support group projects such as charity work, which would allow individuals to know the other person and reduce the gap between them.
In conclusion, the number of individuals missing communication skills is now rising for a variety of reasons, but I believe that if the aforementioned steps are executed in the coming days, this trend will turn, and the number of people without communication skills will be greatly reduced.",0,"In today's society, interpersonal skills are an essential talent to get a job.

To begin with, the primary reason is that advertising campaigns such as the name brand of fast food or junk food targeting children may pose a threat to their health. For example, these adverts with eye-catching colors or interesting slogans fast-food commercials make them easy to purchase unhealthy food. Therefore, this action creates a hazard to the youth's health, and they may suffer from the risk of obesity, and diabetes because of food high in calories or fat and sugar such as candies or high sugar drinks.

For instance, a lot of fascinating adverts such as expensive toys or clothes which children are attracted to and pester their parents to buy commodities may consume more than their families can afford. Consequently, their parents deny purchasing advertised items because they think it is unnecessary to buy for their offspring.
Another important reason is that watching adverts are not a healthy activity. For this reason, these children-aimed advertising programs may harm kids' eyesight.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In recent years, extreme sports are a popular activity that many people have participated in. While some people believe that the authorities should prohibit these sports, there are more convincing reasons why individuals should be given more liberty to practice any physical activity or sport.
On the one hand, there is a common belief that the government should be accountable for prohibiting risky sports. The primary reason is that these kinds of sports can bring many problems to the safety of the players as they may get injured. A mountain climber, for instance, is always in danger of a fatal fall even with the protection of climbing equipment. Besides, being seriously injured while engaging in extreme sports would probably make the athletes give up their careers. Another significant reason is that some dangerous sports, such as boxing, mixed martial arts, or even American football, mostly include many elements of violence. In some way, these sports' audiences would be affected and have aggressive thoughts or improper behaviors in their life.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that participants should take the responsibility of doing sports freely. This is mainly because people have the right to do whatever they prefer and it should be respected. Many world records, for instance, have been broken due to people who dare to take risks and they also ensure that they have enough skills and courage. Besides, the people who disagree should look on the bright side that these extreme sports have brought enormous benefits to the participants such as releasing stress. Moreover, places where providing dangerous sports have been increasingly focusing on the procedures and protective equipment to guarantee the safety of each individual. Thanks to this, many people have overcome their fear to challenge themselves and create many breakthroughs in the sports industry.
In conclusion, although there are some factors that the government should regulate dangerous sports, there are more reasonable grounds that citizens should make their own decisions of doing any sports. It is recommended that the sports industry should be invested more by the authorities as it can relate positively to the development of tourism and economy business.",0,"In recent years, extreme sports are a popular activity that many people have participated in.

2366,21,Some people think that advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"people's opinions differ as to whether or not advertising ﻿targeted at kids should be prohibited. While there are some arguments against advertising aimed at children, I still believe it should not be completely banned.
The primary reason for my belief is that there are a variety of advertisements that not only have positive influences on children's behavior but also give them moral messages. For instance, advertisements of the Ph of toothpaste encourage youngsters to stay clean by brushing their teeth every day to keep their teeth healthy, or Lifebouy's advertisements tell them to wash their hands before eating. As a result, if there were a complete ban on advertising aimed at children, it might be workable for that for fast food or high sugar drinks, but that which provides moral messages could not reach the kids. In addition, advertising is proved to be one of the best ways to teach children because it is viral and gets access to children by interesting songs or lively animation.
Another reason why i think banning advertisements from children is not a good idea is that it will make a large number of people unemployed. If the ban were effective, the sales and profits of companies would gradually decrease. As a result, they have to cut down on the number of employees as big companies such as Coca Cola and Kfc provide thousands of employment opportunities in advertising. It leads to the fact that the government must provide financial support for unemployed people, which has a negative impact on the economy as well
In conclusion, advertisements targeted at children should not be prohibited due to their benefits for kids and impact on employees.

While this approach proves effective to some extent, there are other effective measures.
There are a few benefits, to some extent, of having rehabilitated offenders talking to schoolchildren about the hazards of committing an offense. To begin with, students will be more convinced and truly understanding if they hear about the real-life experience of people who have been released from prison. Those can share with the young people the story about their engaging in unlawful acts as well as the threats associated with a criminal lifestyle. Hence, students are given much useful advice that not only acts as a deterrent to the undesirable chances to commit a crime but also raises an individual's awareness of becoming a good citizen.

The causes of this phenomenon may be due to the lack of infrastructure and the increase in motor vehicles. It has some measures that may promote people to use bicycles more, which include investing in bike path networks and rising the cost of fuel.
The tendency of using fewer cycles is caused by some reasons. The first one is that the path network for cyclists has not been constructed yet or it has been built but lacked cycle facilities. It forces cyclists to make use of busy or dangerous roads that are used by other vehicles. These situations lead to citizens having a sense of insecurity when they ride on the road. The second reason is that people nowadays have numerous vehicles to use. Commuters, for example, can go to work by private vehicles or by public transport.

3149,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"The disparity in the young's knowledge between international celebrities who seem to be known thoroughly and historical figures who are likely to be unaware of is a major topic of concern in today's world. This trend can be ascribed to the rapid growth of social media and the tedious teaching style at school. Some effective measures, such as producing historical movies and ameliorating the teaching method, should be adopted to pique young adults' curiosity in learning about famous people from the past.
There are two compelling reasons as to why young generations tend to be more familiar with worldwide stars than historical figures. First of all, social media's expansion is conducive to this phenomenon. In modern society, there are a myriad of online newspapers which describe the life of famous people. Also, with the increase in the number of innovative platforms, it might be more convenient for the young to access these kinds of posts. As a consequence, young adults will care more about those stars. Additionally, the monotonous way of approaching history at school might be the precursor to this trend. Teachers are likely to ramble on about famous people from history or let students learn by heart many chapters of a thick book. Therefore, these pupils will have a common misperception that studying history simply involves remembering people.
There are a number of viable solutions to engage students in learning historical people. First, film producers could produce more historical films in order to convey more intriguing history stories. In Korea, for example, filmmakers are likely to create more films on the Joseon Dynasty and invite some celebrities to join the cast. Thereby, a wide range of young public general pay more attention to this reign. Second, teachers should ameliorate the teaching style at school by using several strategies such as vivid sounds or puzzle games instead of words. They also could tell more about the accomplishment that these people had achieved rather than just telling his or her background and related dates.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"The decreasing number of people travel by bike is rising to be a noticeable concern.

As in the recent days, people have to travel a lot in their daily lives: commute to work, go to pick up their children, go on a vacation. That matter of fact gradually makes bikes become more inferior to other means such as cars, trains, motorbike or plane, which not only can be time-consuming but also provide better traveling condition. On the stand of individuality, owning a bike and utilizing it everyday is not a sign to show a person's wealth and social status. Since the world is moving toward material-oriented growth, it is becoming more significant for users to possess luxurious devices as asset, and obviously, an international-brand car or motorbike would be the best choice.
The solving steps for this case should be taken by both individual and governments. People should think of the environmental problems first and foremost, as their awareness is raised, it would be more feasible for them to voluntarily use bikes more. Moreover, effective campaigns should also be held by governments with impressive incentives physically and mentally. For example, a bike-riding trip around the city can help people slow their living pace down and realize bicycles' advantages.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that teenagers' reading and writing skills are negatively affected by increasingly using modern communication devices, including computers and mobile phones. I completely disagree with this opinion because more and more utilising electronic devices brings enormous benefits not only to reading skills but also to writing skills.
There are two crucial factors behind the advantages of teenagers' reading skills by increasingly applying digital devices. Firstly, computers and mobile phones can be really good motivational tools to enhance their attention and working memory because adolescents may be attracted by vivid digital text and multimedia reading activities. For example, the Book Trailers for Readers application helps youths to spark enthusiasm for reading through teaser videos and then share positive responses in their working memory with reading communities. Secondly, electronically powered devices give adolescents additional opportunities to improve reading comprehension and to build background knowledge, since they can access images and other content to expand their knowledge of time periods, locations, and contexts. Students reading independently, for instance, could use mobile phones to scan Qr codes placed in books, so it is easy for them to access related media and learn more about the books.
Using more and more electronic devices, namely computers and mobile phones, plays a vital role in enhancing writing skills. Firstly, increasingly utilising search engines could improve research skills because teenagers should collect accurate answers from reputable sources, analyse the findings and make reasonable conclusions before writing. As research skills are the backbone of all types of writing, youths are not able to quickly seek accurate sources out or glean essential information without using search engines. Secondly, editing skills may be improved if youths use the help of grammar checkers, since these tools assist adolescents in catching inevitable typing and grammar errors whenever they use words to convey the desired tone. Without using grammar checkers, young people may not know where the language errors need to be corrected, which leads to the lack of editing skills and even to the extent of distorting the messages.

In other words, if the travelers were not prepared fully, it would be dangerous for them to travel especially when they are alone. For instance, the temperature at the South Pole is dramatical cold.

Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","In recent years, the retail business in various provincial areas has been experiencing a challenging phase, as its frequent customers are changing their preferences to driving to urban retail properties. This transition is causing difficulties for the non-car population and triggering them to purchase a car, therefore resulting in a rise in the ownership of automobiles. While this phenomenon may be associated with some advantages, the shortcomings are certainly far more serious.
On the one hand, the aforementioned change may be advantageous in a few respects. The primary reason is that ownership and usage of cars provide a person with the opportunity for personal control and autonomy, and reduce the dependence on public transportation, which is usually limited and deficient in suburban areas. Furthermore, increased individual purchase of cars enables the flourish of the automobile and petrol industries, which encourages investment in the area and leads to more rapid economic growth.

This transition is causing difficulties for the non-car population and triggering them to purchase a car, therefore resulting in a rise in the ownership of automobiles. While this phenomenon may be associated with some advantages, the shortcomings are certainly far more serious. On the one hand, the aforementioned change may be advantageous in a few respects. The primary reason is that ownership and usage of cars provide a person with the opportunity for personal control and autonomy, and reduce the dependence on public transportation, which is usually limited and deficient in suburban areas. Furthermore, increased individual purchase of cars enables the flourish of the automobile and petrol industries, which encourages investment in the area and leads to more rapid economic growth.

There are some reasons which is conducive to the lack of basic skills in new workers. The main cause is the mistake in the way schools training their students.

971,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"The paucity of using bicycles as a mode of transportation in numerous places has recently been brought into question in spite of the fact that it is more beneficial for physical conditions and environmentally- friendly compared to car, train or aircraft. This trend could be ascribed to a few reasons, and several feasible solutions would be proposed to promote the use of bikes.
To commence with, the reasons behind this trend fall into two underlying categories. First and foremost, bike riding is inferior to motorized forms of transport such as motorbikes or cars in a number of dimensions. To be more specific, it is the sedentary lifestyle and an ever-increasing hustle of people in the modern world that results in their over-reliance on other cutting-edge vehicles powered by gas or electricity even on the shortest journeys, while riding bicycles is physically demanding and time-consuming. The second prominent catalyst is that cycling undoubtedly poses a greater threat to users than driving a car or riding motorbikes. Facts indicate that should an accident happen, a bike rider is more prone to serious injuries or even fatalities. Last but not least, a lack of dedicated cycling paths in many areas in the world, including Vietnam can be attributed to the unpopularity of bikes these days. This means that cyclists in those places have to ride in the same lanes with motor vehicles; that being said, bicycles are no longer a suitable option.
A plethora of solutions could be adopted to boost the use of bicycles. It is advisable that governments impose heavy tax on fossil fuels as well as on other forms of transport. With this policy being adopted, competent authorities make it possible to mitigate the use of non-environmentally friendly modes of transport and encourage many people to opt for bikes on short trips. Furthermore, it is suggested that more budgets should be spent on building roads exclusively for bike-riders which help them to separate from other types of transport, thus being guarded against dangers. Furthermore, authorities should hold monthly green days that by law require citizens to cycle to work to get people participated in protecting their environment. Such an initiative would help to gradually form a habit of cycling among occupied individuals in the long run. More significantly, propagation via various means of social platforms as well as optional courses about the benefits of cycling to the environment at schools is of great worth to foster social consciousness of this matter. Finally, it is suggested that more budgets should be spent on building traveling infrastructures exclusively for bike-riders which help them to separate from other types of transport, thus being protected against accidents.
In summary, cycling, irrespective of its positive influences on the environment, has become a rare picture in daily life for a number of reasons such as its inconvenience and the shortage of social infrastructure. Strong measures including tax and awareness raising should be immediately implemented to deal with this situation.",0,"The paucity of using bicycles as a mode of transportation in numerous places has recently been brought into question in spite of the fact that it is more beneficial for physical conditions and environmentally- friendly compared to car, train or aircraft.

First and foremost, bike riding is inferior to motorized forms of transport such as motorbikes or cars in a number of dimensions. To be more specific, it is the sedentary lifestyle and an ever-increasing hustle of people in the modern world that results in their over-reliance on other cutting-edge vehicles powered by gas or electricity even on the shortest journeys, while riding bicycles is physically demanding and time-consuming. The second prominent catalyst is that cycling undoubtedly poses a greater threat to users than driving a car or riding motorbikes. Facts indicate that should an accident happen, a bike rider is more prone to serious injuries or even fatalities. Last but not least, a lack of dedicated cycling paths in many areas in the world, including Vietnam can be attributed to the unpopularity of bikes these days. This means that cyclists in those places have to ride in the same lanes with motor vehicles; that being said, bicycles are no longer a suitable option. A plethora of solutions could be adopted to boost the use of bicycles. It is advisable that governments impose heavy tax on fossil fuels as well as on other forms of transport. With this policy being adopted, competent authorities make it possible to mitigate the use of non-environmentally friendly modes of transport and encourage many people to opt for bikes on short trips. Furthermore, it is suggested that more budgets should be spent on building roads exclusively for bike-riders which help them to separate from other types of transport, thus being guarded against dangers. Furthermore, authorities should hold monthly green days that by law require citizens to cycle to work to get people participated in protecting their environment. Such an initiative would help to gradually form a habit of cycling among occupied individuals in the long run. More significantly, propagation via various means of social platforms as well as optional courses about the benefits of cycling to the environment at schools is of great worth to foster social consciousness of this matter. Finally, it is suggested that more budgets should be spent on building traveling infrastructures exclusively for bike-riders which help them to separate from other types of transport, thus being protected against accidents. In summary, cycling, irrespective of its positive influences on the environment, has become a rare picture in daily life for a number of reasons such as its inconvenience and the shortage of social infrastructure. Strong measures including tax and awareness raising should be immediately implemented to deal with this situation.",3086,533,19,4.866791744840525,127,142,56,78,29
4764,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Many people have changed themselves to be a better person after they have been released from confinement. And some people believe that the ex-prisoners can give good advice for pupils to avoid committing offence.
Although there are a few reasons why it effectively reduces the rate of juvenile delinquency by having a talk between criminals with teenagers, there are more reasonable grounds that parents and teachers are better to teach them about violations of the law.
To begin with, there are some arguments that the released prisoners can talk with adolescents to decrease the proportion of juvenile delinquency. One important reason is that the criminals after they have been released have witnessed the tough life in the jail. They can share their experience about prison life, the punishment, the types of wrongdoing people get involved in. This arrangement is the great way for teenagers know many kinds of violation and how they suffer for it. Moreover, the ex-prisoners will guide students through the loss of living away from families and good resources. When they commit a crime, they will be separated from their relatives, shunned by neighbors and other people, and lossed the opportunity to grow.
However, there is stronger factor that parents vs teachers are the crucial key to help children avoid committing a crime. People will learn faster and more effectively when they were young, so students should know about misbehavior that they must avoid at an early age. Parents and teachers in schools should teach the way to avoid wrongdoings instead of criminals.

4970,20,Countries should try to produce all the food for the population and import as little food as possible. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"An increase in population means higher demands for food supply. It is the responsibility of each country to ensure food adequacy for the whole population. While countries should reduce the amount of imported food in a few aspects, there is more convincing evidence that they should be independent in producing food for their citizens.
Countries should import food as little as possible. This is primarily because it costs a huge amount of money to import food from other countries. It also put pressure on the national budget, which should be invested more in education, healthcare as well as national economy. Furthermore, decreasing imported food can contribute to environmental protection. In detail, large transportation such as ships and aeroplanes... hold accountable for importing food, which requires a lot of energy. As a result, natural resources will be exhausted and there will be a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution.
The reasons why nations should manufacture their food for their population domestically are more compelling. To begin with, if the demands for food in the country increased, agriculture would develop and offer job opportunities for the citizens. People would be more involved in farming and food industries, the unemployment rates would be at a low level. This also results in an adequate food supply for each country annually. The second reason is that food is controlled better when being produced within the country. The government can monitor the way food is processed to ensure its origin, safety and hygiene. Therefore, it meets the requirements of freshness and high quality, instead of degraded food imported from a long distance.
In brief, imported food should be reduced and each country should manufacture its food for the population.

6654,0,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Hazardous sports have long been a major topic of concern for many participants in recent years. While some people maintain that individuals should be free to do any kind of sport, there are more persuasive reasons why dangerous sports should be prohibited.
On the one hand, permitting people to participate in any sport is true in a few respects, and one of them is that choosing a sport is a matter of personal preference. In other words, people usually opt for a particular sport based on their personality traits. For instance, activities such as skiing or bungee jumping would be desirable options for risk-takers, which have a positive influence on their mental health and emotions. In addition, when participants have to encounter threats, they have to be well-prepared for possible dangers to save themselves. For example, when people want to adventure into an isolated forest, they should be conscious of its extreme weather or dangerous animals to know how to encounter these problems.
On the other hand, there is more compelling evidence that the state should forbid hazardous activities. A major reason for this is that it can lead to an increase in the human workforce. Admittedly, as soon as dangerous sports are no longer available, their participants, especially professionals would lose their jobs, so the government ought to provide job-training courses for them to find alternatives such as business or education, which can contribute greatly to the advancement of a nation. Another reason is that this prohibition can result in a rise in the government budget. When the national authority no longer has to spend money on manufacturing equipment or organizing competitions, this fund can be employed for other sectors for example education or industry, which are more vital to the country's economy.

3119,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent decades, although cycling has been known as an effective way to improve people's mental health, people have still hesitated to use bicycles to commute. Some explanations for this trend will be put forward before a few feasible solutions are proposed.
There are two main reasons for the uncommon use of bicycles. The primary one is that cycling is time-consuming when travelling from one place to another in the hectic schedule of people in modern society, which may negatively affect people's work quality and other activities. For example, it would be a challenge for people on the outskirts whose offices are in the city center to arrive at their work places on time, while punctuality is a crucial habit at work. In addition, pedling is more physically demanding than the motorized means of transport and is easily subject to extreme weather and hostile environments such as heat waves, whereas driving a car is evently more comfortable for all ages, ranging from infants to seniors, regardless of their physical condition.
However, the government plays a vital role in stimulating the use of this environmentally friendly vehicle. Firstly, the authorities can conduct monthly green days, which require citizens to cycle to school or work by law in order to raise people's awareness of protecting the environment. In the long term, such an initiative would help to gradually form a habit of cycling among occupied individuals. Secondly, the provision of cyclist-friendly facilities will be essential to boost the use of bicycles. Paving cycling lanes on main roads and cycling tracks in public parks or suburban areas is likely to deal with people's safety concerns about pedaling through fast-moving vehicles. Therefore, they can enjoy their healthy and friendly trips.
In conclusion, the unpopularity of bicycles can be ascribed to a few factors, including wasting a large amount of time and being dependent on the weather.

2299,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later.

While having a dialogue between ex-prisoners and school students is a effective pedaogy, it is far from the best way to educate children about law
Rehabilitated offenders have experience about the prison life and the types of wrongdoing people get involved in;therefore they can share those experience with the teenagers and young people are more likely to accept advice from someone who speaks from real life experience. Adolescents, whereas are often disregard for the guidance of the older or their parents, they will be attracted by the stories of ex-lawbreakers. Teenagers should ask the offenders many questions because they are the best person to answer those question and this will have a powerful impact on fresh mind
However, having ex-offenders give a discussion to young people is not the best method of education to tell them about the badness of breaking the law. The another alternative method is for police officers or lawyers to visit schools and talk with young person about the law.

While having a dialogue between ex-prisoners and school students is a effective pedaogy, it is far from the best way to educate children about law Rehabilitated offenders have experience about the prison life and the types of wrongdoing people get involved in;therefore they can share those experience with the teenagers and young people are more likely to accept advice from someone who speaks from real life experience. Adolescents, whereas are often disregard for the guidance of the older or their parents, they will be attracted by the stories of ex-lawbreakers. Teenagers should ask the offenders many questions because they are the best person to answer those question and this will have a powerful impact on fresh mind However, having ex-offenders give a discussion to young people is not the best method of education to tell them about the badness of breaking the law. The another alternative method is for police officers or lawyers to visit schools and talk with young person about the law.

7027,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"In today's society, many companies find that a number of their junior workers lack common mutual skills. This phenomenon is attributed to several reasons and must be addressed by definite actions.
A lack of basic interpersonal skills stems from several causes. The primary reason is that tertiary education nowadays places more emphasis on teaching students with academic knowledge rather than equipping them with fundamental soft skills. To get a perfect degree, students, in particular, need to concentrate on lectures and get high marks in every subject, which prevents them from developing other communicative skills such as listening or cooperative skills. Therefore, once getting into the workforce, fresh graduates are unable to collaborate well with their co-workers and get low productivity at work despite being qualified. Another cause worth mentioning is that parents, especially from Asia, could have children get a high academic result at school because they believe that admission to a prestigious university is equivalent to a prospective future career.
However, a number of actions could be adopted by governments and parents to remedy the problem. To reform the education system, the government could put into students' curriculums more courses which may encourage every student to interact more with each other or listen to others with a sympathetic ear. Therefore, they would be confident enough to cooperate effectively in the workplace. On the individual scale, students should spend more time on activities such as participating in volunteer work or joining workshops where experts could provide their useful knowledge and experience, which students could apply to their career future.
In conclusion, a shortage of interpersonal skills in new employees can be ascribed to the education system and parental teaching, and there are also some feasible solutions to tackle the issue. If this trend persists, the companies' growth might be negatively affected due to the lack of collaboration between senior workers and junior workers who don't possess basic soft skills.",0,"In today's society, many companies find that a number of their junior workers lack common mutual skills.

On the one hand, it is an obvious fact that dangerous sports activities have involved a high degree of physical danger. Even when all safety precaution has taken, there are still inevitable circumstances such as severe injury and fatal incidents. To be more specific, those extreme athletes have subjected people to certain risks which they may, many a time, be aware of but they are still driven by the adrenaline rush. Compared to other sports according to the standardly accepted definition, adventure sports such as surfing, cliff diving, boxing, and so on involve a greater threat to life and incorporate the presence of physical danger. Along with physical risk, there has arisen the mental breakdown in people who are not compatible with such types and they may be obsessed with scare. In general, those activities may lead to many mishaps for both physical and mental elements.
On the other hand, it is controversial that there is a myriad of benefits from participating in dangerous sports. First of all, it seems possible to realize that most people have engaged in those activities due to the thrilling feeling they brought. To clarify more clearly, the adrenaline flow stimulates the feeling of pleasure and euphoria which satisfy participants in some cases. In others words, the most significant thing found in adventure sports is experiential value. Moreover, overcoming obstacles in challenging athletes support youngsters in conquering their fear and their own limit when they are dare to expose themselves to avoidable risks. Finally, dangerous sports are supposed to provide people with a full-body workout. By pushing your body's limit, it is an opportunity to improve your balance, endurance and even muscle strength.

It is believed that the big cities are attractive to live, and have wide range of opportunities to work, entertainment, education and leisure activities.

One of the main cause of the problem is traffic and air pollution. To specify, most big cities are filled with cars, and there is a great deal of traffic congestion. Additionally, cars which are in the city, produces harmful gases on the air, so many people are suffering from bad disease, such as asthma. To tackle this problem, the government should make a law, which is introducing a congestion tax for entering city center. As a result, the number of vehicles have been cut in the road.

For example, a friend of mine who study in the Uk said that the cost of even one bedroom is considerably expensive for him. So that he need to stay in the suburban, and always go to university take half hours from his flat.

5229,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Bicycles have been considered as an eco-friendly vehicle and an effective method to have good physical health. Nevertheless, it is evident that bicycles are less used as a form of transport worldwide. The following essay will outline several potential reasons leading to this tendency and point out effective measures to tackle this issue.
To commence with, this trend could be ascribed to several convincing reasons. First and foremost, the overdependence on modern vehicles such as motorbikes or cars discourages people from utilising bikes in their daily routine. To illustrate, motorbikes or cars prove to be faster and more convenient during long journeys, which can take much more time to ride. Hence, people can spend more time on other activities such as working, learning, or resting. Another valid reason is that in various parts of the world, there are no dedicated paths for bicycle riders. This shortcoming forces cyclists to commute on the same lanes with other means of transport, which poses a serious threat to riders and lessens their velocity.
To boost the prevalence of bicycles, the government plays a crucial role in the introduction of several policies. One of the most effective measures is to allocate governmental funds to construct constant traffic systems for cyclists. The more specialised lanes for bicycles are erected, the higher safety can be ensured for commuters, which encourages more people to use bicycles in their daily life. In addition, governments are advisable to adopt strict taxes on both fuels and motor vehicles. This rising expenditure would discourage people from considering modern modes of transport as their daily vehicles and an enormous number of citizens would switch to using bicycles on their short-distance journeys.
In conclusion, the declining number of cyclists can result from the overreliance on motorbikes or cars and the scarcity of dedicated lanes for bicycles. Nonetheless, this issue can be dealt with by the construction of specialised paths for bicycles and the imposition of heavier taxes on fuels and motor vehicles.",0,"Bicycles have been considered as an eco-friendly vehicle and an effective method to have good physical health.

Finally, dangerous activities such as boxing or automobile racing may lead to illicit betting, which can lead to societal issues such as stealing or violence.
However, opponents of this view point out that social members should feel free to do any sports. The explanation for this might be because many individuals can express their passions and abilities in their preferred sports in order to realize their dreams of becoming professional athletes.

On the one hand, living abroad has many disadvantages. First of all, it is a climate difference because the climate in many western countries is different from that in many eastern countries. For example, Vietnam has a tropical climate, so in winter, the temperature is from about 15 to 25. However, many western countries are too cold to have snow in winter. Secondly, one of the most difficult things is the language barrier because local people are familiar with communicating by their mother tongue, their melody and emotion in each speech.
On the other hand, the more difficult things are, the more advantages. To begin with building global relationships, many students from different countries can share together about culture, tradition, food and so on in their country. Therefore, they can create connections with loads of friends. Moreover, living in another country helps people to become more independent because of living alone. For instance, a student abroad will arrange a plan for a week in order to both raise money and study. If newcomers do not have to learn many skills such as planning, self care and job hunting, they cannot adapt to a new environment.
In conclusion, living abroad has disadvantages more than advantages. It is recommended that newcomers are aware of the challenges and learn to deal with them.",0,"Stepping into the twenty-first century, the number of people who move to other countries for job or educational purposes is increasing.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"As the internet technology continues to disrupt our life, many people assume that the contemporary computer, mobile device-based communication will lay an adverse impact on the young who excel at utilizing these communication tools.

On the face of things, it may seem that the increasing amount of communication conducted on computers and mobile devices by youngsters leads to decline in time for writing letters and essays alike. However, communication taking place on digital devices actually requires concise and cohesive writing as well. Take a young person working from home as an example, if she is to report to her co-workers about an incident at work, she will need to write in an organized and brief way so that her co-worker can grasp the idea at ease. Another case is to create an engaging post on social media and maximize audience reach, one would need to write in a creative but easy to understand way.
Another reason to not degrade how digital communication affects the young is that by having to deal with the staggering amount of information on the internet, young people acquire the skimming and scanning skills. This, as a result, enhances their reading skills. So as to extract the suitable and meaningful piece from the astounding data on the internet, youngsters will eventually equip themselves with the skills of skimming passages and scanning for the important information. As a consequence, their reading capacity will develop in terms of quality and quantity.

In my opinion, there are both benefits and drawbacks to deciding to do this. In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons why moving abroad is so popular, as well as some of the difficulties that must be faced.
On the one hand, there are several strong reasons to relocate to another country. To begin with, visiting overseas allows me to expand my horizons. Individuals who work or study abroad have several possibilities to interact with people from various cultures, as well as to learn about diverse cultures' traditions and cuisines. They have brought them many useful life experiences since then. Second, working or studying in a different country can enhance one's quality of life.

On the other hand, immigrants abroad can face many difficulties. Not integrating into the culture of that country is one of the most obvious problems. People who spend a lot of time in other countries are more likely to have difficulty with language barriers, as well as differences in cuisine and culture. This can lead to feelings of homesickness and in some cases loneliness and even autism. Another difficulty is that starting a new life from scratch is certainly difficult. In other words, when people move abroad, they have to establish new acquaintances and find their place in a new place, which takes time, effort and can be difficult if there is a language barrier.

5636,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, more and more attention has been centered around the topic of crime control and prevention in young adults. In my opinion, I believe that inviting formal offenders to school to teach about the danger of criminal behavior can be extremely effective in terms of reducing crime in children. However, it is far from being the best way to solve this problem.
On the one hand, there are a few reasons why being taught by ex-prisoners is beneficial for school students. The greatest reason is that these people are telling the story from their own experience, about their upcoming, the circumstances that lead them to criminal behaviors, and the real life behind bars. This is a great way for children to learn about the criminal lifestyle, and the consequences that come with it, without being sugar-coated as it is often seen in Hollywood movies. Another reason is this is a way more interesting method for children to learn, rather than just plain theory lessons at school.
On the other hand, I am convinced that there are better alternatives to tackle this issue. This is mainly because even though people who have been in prisons can be a great example for the kids, it is extremely hard to evaluate whether they are suitable for teaching young children or not. In other words, without any former teaching experience, they can unintentionally send the wrong messages to the students, which results in children having misconceptions about the outlaws. In addition, other methods of teaching that require parents and teachers to help their kids make responsible decisions are incredibly crucial in order to lower the criminal rate in young adults.
In conclusion, while former convicts can teach students many valuable lessons, it is more important for kids to learn to respect rules and orders wherever they go. It is recommended that parents and teachers should teach children from a young age to avoid criminal behaviors, and help them make better choices in life.",0,"In recent years, more and more attention has been centered around the topic of crime control and prevention in young adults.

However, it is far from being the best way to solve this problem. On the one hand, there are a few reasons why being taught by ex-prisoners is beneficial for school students. The greatest reason is that these people are telling the story from their own experience, about their upcoming, the circumstances that lead them to criminal behaviors, and the real life behind bars. This is a great way for children to learn about the criminal lifestyle, and the consequences that come with it, without being sugar-coated as it is often seen in Hollywood movies. Another reason is this is a way more interesting method for children to learn, rather than just plain theory lessons at school. On the other hand, I am convinced that there are better alternatives to tackle this issue. This is mainly because even though people who have been in prisons can be a great example for the kids, it is extremely hard to evaluate whether they are suitable for teaching young children or not. In other words, without any former teaching experience, they can unintentionally send the wrong messages to the students, which results in children having misconceptions about the outlaws. In addition, other methods of teaching that require parents and teachers to help their kids make responsible decisions are incredibly crucial in order to lower the criminal rate in young adults. In conclusion, while former convicts can teach students many valuable lessons, it is more important for kids to learn to respect rules and orders wherever they go. It is recommended that parents and teachers should teach children from a young age to avoid criminal behaviors, and help them make better choices in life.",1979,363,13,4.542699724517906,83,84,40,59,14
4091,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent decades, there has been a prevalent trend that people use bicycles less to commute. This phenomenon can be ascribed to several underlying explanations and some possible solutions can be taken to promote the usage of this form of transportation.
There are several factors that contribute to the decline in the number of bicycle riders. Firstly, the inconvenience in long-distance trips and the shortage of physical strength act as catalysts for the users' disfavor. Indeed, rather than riding a bike to a remote area and being drenched in sweat, people prefer either a motorcycle or a car for a long journey, which is obviously less time-consuming and exhausting. Secondly, another prominent reason is that in a variety of countries, the infrastructure is not developed enough to be bicycle-friendly. For example, in Vietnam, that there are no cycling paths on the roads poses risks of colliding with other vehicles and involving in serious accidents to the cyclists.
Therefore, a number of measures could be adopted to encourage individuals to use this means of transportation more. In the first place, the government should impose a heavy tax on motor vehicles and simultaneously, lower the price of bicycles. This action will thus discourage citizens from choosing other types of transportation such as automobiles and stimulate them to switch to cycling due to economical benefits. In addition to this, it is advisable for authorized entities that they allocate more money to the innovation of roads, streets, and traffic. Such development must include the construction of special lanes for cyclists, public parking zones, as well as the application of bicycle racks mounted to the front of buses and trams to combine cycling with public transport.
In conclusion, despite many positive aspects in terms of health and environment, the unpopularity of bikes derives from various causes. Unfortunately, it is predicted that unless these remedies are employed, it will be significantly challenging for this human-powered land vehicle to regain the commuters' preference.",0,"In recent decades, there has been a prevalent trend that people use bicycles less to commute.

While this trend is beneficial to some extent, I believe that the drawbacks are more significant.
On the one hand, going to remote areas is advantageous in a few aspects. There is a big opportunity for scientists to explore more necessary information for research processes, or they even can find new things that humans do not know about remote natural environments. For instance, new and exotic species can be found out when explorers visit remote areas. Besides, visiting remote areas facilitate the expansion of travel destination in the world. Instead of going to common travel areas, tourists now can visit the remote natural environment where stimulate their curiosity by new and interesting things there.
On the other hand, this trend has some negative sides that need to be considered carefully. Firstly, traveling to remote natural areas can be risky for humans. Remote areas usually are difficult to reach by the danger of their terrain or severe weather, so if people do not prepare for the trip sufficiently, their health can be severely affected. Take the South Pole where the temperature is extremely low as an example, its temperature can pose threat to people's health. Secondly, these natural areas can be lost their pristine by human interference. When humans overexploit for research purposes or take advantage of these areas for tourism, it is difficult for them to keep their beauty and pristine, or even cause environmental pollution.
In conclusion, although going traveling to the remote natural environment has some benefits, its drawbacks are far outweighed because of the danger for humans and the preservation of natural areas.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","Numerous small town-centre shops are going bankrupt due to the growing tendency towards large out-of-town stores, which leads to an increase in the owning of private cars. This change is associated with significant adverse effects that outweigh the advantages.
The development of large shopping malls on the outskirts as a replacement for small town-centre stores is deemed to have several benefits. Large stores are often accompanied by other recreational facilities such as cinema, leisure centre, restaurants and so on. Therefore, people will have greater shopping experience and it tends to boost consumption as people spend not only on their listed goods but also on other activities available in malls, which will in turn benefit retailers and the store in general. These changes have positive effects on the economy. Another significant benefit is reducing pressure on the centre in terms of infrastructure and traffic. Small shops can be demolished for the constructions of other necessary facilities including accommodation areas, schools or health centre. Traffic congestion will be reduced in the centre as people no longer have to commute among small shops in the centre for their daily shopping, which is sometimes inconvenient.
However, there are more considerable disadvantages regarding to this change. An increase in demand for private cars is inevitable; however, this is against the policy that many governments are aiming at in order to solve inherent global problems relating to pollution and congestion. Increasing private cars means greater amount of toxic emissions released into the atmosphere and higher volume of traffic in streets. These consequences will deteriorate the current situations and is detrimental for the sustainable development. In addition to this, this change creates great inconvenience for people.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In the modern age, there is an increasing number of people who do not use bicycles to commute for their daily activities. There are many reasons for this issue, and should be addressed by some definite remedies.
This problem may be elucidated by two main reasons. An important one is that the indifference of residents to health and environmental issues is now becoming significant, which breeds the decline of cyclists. People are now much concerned about their personal business including livelihoods, families... ; as a result, they spend less time on healthcare and environmental aspects, and they abandon bicycles as a means of transport that may be beneficial to enhancing health conditions and mitigating carbon emissions from various vehicles Besides that, due to the development of technology, many new and more convenient modes of transports such as cars, motorbikes, ... have superseded bicycles as those new ones are faster, more time-saving, and can travel on long distance. A typical example of this is when people have a desire to go on a vacation faraway from their settling, they mostly use cars to travel to their destinations.
A number of solutions could be adopted to tackle the problem associated with the reduction in cyclists. First of all, goverment should launch cycling encouragement campaigns to disseminate the advantages of using bicycles to commute to the residents. If they are conscious of the merits to that bicycles could bring, they are likely to travel by them more. Another measure could be implemented to curb the issue is that authorities should adopt a policy that permits everyone to use high-quality bicycles free of charge. Due to this action, they can be relieved of the expenses of bicycles.

Discuss both views give opinions,"In today's society, children's age for education has become a major topic of concern. While there is a growing tendency among people that education for children should be started at an early age, others believe that it should be started when children are seven years old. In this essay, the rationales behind both opinions will be discussed thoroughly.
On the one hand, there are underlying reasons why many people are in favor of letting children go to school at the age of six and below. First, it is undeniable that the younger the age, the faster children are to adopt new skills and gain insights. According to research conducted by Oxford University, a child learns a language fifteen percent faster at the age of five than when they reach adolescence. As a result, they are more likely to get their brains familiarized with acquiring knowledge, hence being able to analyze information more quickly. In addition to that, attending school at an early age allows children to develop their social and communication skills. In other words, students beginning their school years earlier have more time to engage in school activities and socialize with their peers, thus getting themself acclimated to the campus atmosphere.
However, there is more compelling evidence why students should not attend schools until they reach a certain age. Initially, children having later school enrollment have more time to learn fundamental skills from their parents. Since schools only offer assistance in children's academic prosperity, it is crucial for them to spare the time learning basic courtesy at home, such as the way they speak to adults or how to eat a meal properly. Furthermore, being secluded from the pressure and formality of schools help children to grow a healthier mindset. In detail, without the pressure from school's work and parents' expectations, children are free to discover their interests and enjoy their childhood to the utmost, hence having their cognition and mentality developed properly.
In conclusion, there are certain benefits regarding letting children start formal schooling at an early age, including extra time for socializing and adopting more knowledge. Still, young children should begin their formal education once they are more prepared for their mental stability. It is recommended that young children spend time playing with toys and practicing things they are passionate about to foster their ability to think creatively.",0,"In today's society, children's age for education has become a major topic of concern.

There might be some benefits of having a talk between criminals and students about the hazard associated with crime. The most obvious benefit is that students could learn from offenders who truly understand crime. Students may enlarge their knowledge about the dangers of crime for the victims. In addition, this way may also educate students about the threats to themselves if they commit a crime. Ex-prisoners have experienced a long process of imprisonment and rehabilitation so they can share what prisoners are deprived of and how repentant they feel.
However, there is stronger evidence that there are better methods of educating students about the adverse impacts of taking part in criminal activities.

Firstly, when they send messages to others usually abbreviate their words in order to communicate faster. Speacially, some software programs such as Microsoft Word offer users convenient functions that help correct grammatical mistakes automatically.

As a result, reading practices would obviously lead to poor reading competence. On the other hand, I would argue that the proper use of computers and mobiles phones would significantly contribute to the improvement of reading and writing skills. First reason is that by using those devices with access to the Internet, people can search the information whenever they want. Another reason is that, with the development of social networking sites, people now can easily create blogs and express their thoughts. By writing on a daily basis, their writing skills are certainly improved In conclusion, it seems to me that the use of mobiles phones and computers could have both advantages and disadvantages for the reading and writing skills of the young people.",1778,312,12,4.791666666666667,74,86,27,44,16

This will lead to every children will not face with the high risk of injury and death because of their unawareness. For example, if children watch others do some weird games, they will be curious and try to do these activities whenever they have their own opportunities. This is dangerous because they cannot evaluate what risk can happend and there are no preparation for this. Therefore, the inhibition of dangerous sports is important to people's safety.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that each person should have their rights to choose what sports they want to play.

Therefore, if dangerous sports are banned, everyone cannot experience these games to fullfill themselves. Furthermore, adults have full of their rights to do whatever they want to do because this does not effect others's safety.

What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"Despite the essential role of interpersonal skills in the workplace, there is a great number of freshers lacking these skills. It is probably owing to limitations in the education system and working environments they have been exposed to. Hence, some reforms in education and workplaces should be adopted to address this problem.
There are several primary reasons why plenty of newly hired employees lack basic social skills such as cooperative and communication skills. In the education system, the curriculum from elementary to tertiary level seems to emphasize far more on theoretical subjects than extracurricular activities specializing in job-related skills, resulting in a lack of awareness of the importance of these skills. Particularly, only major-related subjects contribute to pupils' Gpa, which determines how excellent a student's school performance is. Consequently, students tend to only focus on improving their academic results and be indifferent to programs or courses boosting workplace skills. Regarding the internship in companies, fresh graduates are often only trained for specialized individual tasks such as market research, programming, or report writing, and divided into separate workspaces, allowing little interaction with co-workers, hence the poor staff performance in group projects.
To well equip fresh employees with fundamental interpersonal skills, some remedies need to be employed in both study and work environments. In school, there should be adjustments in the curriculum, in which teamwork-oriented subjects should be supplemented and count towards overall pupils' Gpa to motivate them to acquire social skills. Moreover, students should be encouraged to join out of class activities such as competitions requiring cooperation among a group or informal meetings for sharing personal stories, goals, and plans, which can make them more open up to people around and enhance their teamwork skill. In workplaces, all enterprises should facilitate staff interaction by investing in co-working spaces instead of private ones, frequently organizing teambuilding activities, and incorporating more soft skills training for their new employees.

To be specific, when engaging in these extreme sports, making mistakes is inevitable to any player including both amateur and proficient ones; thus some accidents or even risky situations may easily happen. For example, skiing carries an inherent level of risk in various areas, such as a risk of hurting yourself, a risk of others accidentally hurting you, or the risk of an incident on the mountain such as getting lost, exposure to cold, or the risk of avalanches; hence skier may be exposed to many deadly scenarios. In addition, another reason for this is due to the malfunction of equipment related to technical problems while involved in these activities. For instance, skydivers have to encounter some threatening circumstances including faulty parachutes.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that each person should be free to engage in any kind of sport that they wish. One sufficient ground is that there are a great number of thrill-seekers craving for fulfilling their passion with heart-throbbing and exciting experiences. From a morality perspective, it must be unfair if there is a ban to forbid them to take part in activities they love. Moreover, while participating in these sports, people can achieve many unforgettable memories which can never be witnessed if they just live a tedious life with their safety net. An opportunity to acquire knowledge and improve health quality is also a good explanation for this. For instance, mountaineering is a sport that helps players to improve their physical health especially in the blood circulation. The final reason is that there are multiple ways which help minimize the risks that pose to players, such as developing the quality of equipment or hiring professional instructors.
In conclusion, although it seems advisable that a ban on dangerous sports might be beneficial, there are more benefits of allowing people to take part in any sport they want. It is recommended that individuals engage in dangerous activities with strong insurance and knowledge.",0,"In contemporary society, there have been arguments surrounding whether hazardous sports should be prohibited.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Many people believe that young people should focus on cultural activities such as music and theatre while take less time on sport. I partly disagree with this opinion.
On the one hand, I agree that young people had better spend time on the cultural activities. These activities are good for their mental health. As many researches done before, cultural activities like music, art, theatre bring positive energy, which helps their minds become healthier and reduce stress. For example, a music show may allow teenagers to forget their stressful situations and bring them motivation to go on their plans, or the way they enjoying art will make them feel more relaxed.
However, young people also need to take time on sports as much as they spend on the cultural activities. Play sports such as swimming, playing football, going jogging, cycling... can be beneficial to their physical health. If teenagers want to keep fit, they should do exercises or play sports, they may have more energy to study.

First of all, it cannot be denied that in addition to the abiliti to help young people entertain and relieve stress, cultural activities also have powerful educational and inspirational values. Thanks to music, literature and some other cultural heritages which are preserved through generations and exchanged between different countries, young people can learn more about their history and origin, thereby form pride in the nation and the identity that they represent.

In my opinion, there are several reasons for this reality and we can raise the young's interest in gaining knowledge about their own well-known people in the past in many ways.
The primary reason why people know more about international pop and movie stars is that international films are very modern and appealing with beautiful actors and actresses. Therefore, the young nowadays spend almost time watching movies or surfing international entertainment websites to get more information about their idols instead of watching historical programs on television. Another reason is that history itself is not attractive so if teachers fail to make history lessons more interesting, students will suffer from boredom time at school, which leads to their low interest in this subject.
There are many ways to create more interest in the young to learn about their own famous people in the past. At school, changing teaching methods in history to make fascinating lessons can be a positive way. Instead of only talking, teachers may let children watch some historical movies or use pictures to demonstrate historic events. Teachers also should hold more extracurricular activities relating to important people or events in the past to let children know about the glorious period of their country. Moreover, parents sometimes can take their children to museums, and libraries, where the young can see several historical items such as clothes, hats, guns, and jewelry.... then children may be curious and want to gain more information about these items.

This essay will clarify both views in detail, however, I believe that formal education should be put into practice after the age of seven.

Secondly, they think that the sooner toddlers start learning, the more knowledge they gain. It is no doubt that it takes time to broaden one's horizon, therefore, for some, it is essential to start formal education early.
Conversely, that other shows strong arguments toward this idea approves taking formal curriculum after seven years old. The root of this comes from the anxiety that children might be burned out if they have it too early. Not only can they feel the lessons dull as they have been taught it before officially have it at school but they also can be down under pressure of their parents' marks expectation. Therefore, they would find it hard to become interested in schooling again. Another reason is that the children under seven do not have their logical ability fully developed. These children would learn things passively without any awareness of what they mean to them and find it difficult to take in information teachers give. This leads to the low performance at school and their results cannot satisfy their parents.

1376,4,Some people think that increasing communication usage of computers and mobile phones by young people has had a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, with the development of modern technology, people can experience several convenient things, such as texting, calling video to friends and family, etc; so the number of people using phones and computers is rising. However, this development accidentally causes a bad influence on one's ability to read and write.
There are evident reasons that hi-tech devices can lead to the deterioration of one's reading skill. The primary reason is that the smart devices make people, especially students, unable to maintain the reading habit, which results in a lack of knowledge. Most children in today's time spend much time surfing the Internet, playing video games, etc; and less time reading books. According to Labor Statistics, people in the age between 15 and 44 in the Us spend 10 minutes or less per day reading, which is too little for a day. As a result, people would not have enough specific knowledge about subjects and life. Moreover, due to the lack of interest in reading, students only read because of their homework, which concerns bad results at schools.
Not only does the electronic media harm one's reading skills, it can cause a negative impact on writing skill. This is primarily because of the informal style while texting.

However, this development accidentally causes a bad influence on one's ability to read and write. There are evident reasons that hi-tech devices can lead to the deterioration of one's reading skill. The primary reason is that the smart devices make people, especially students, unable to maintain the reading habit, which results in a lack of knowledge. Most children in today's time spend much time surfing the Internet, playing video games, etc; and less time reading books. According to Labor Statistics, people in the age between 15 and 44 in the Us spend 10 minutes or less per day reading, which is too little for a day. As a result, people would not have enough specific knowledge about subjects and life. Moreover, due to the lack of interest in reading, students only read because of their homework, which concerns bad results at schools. Not only does the electronic media harm one's reading skills, it can cause a negative impact on writing skill. This is primarily because of the informal style while texting.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowaday, it is feasible for people, especially who work for science and tourism to get to natural areas that are distant such as South Pole. There are more reasonable evidence why the positive effects of this outnumber the drawbacks.
On the one hand, that scientists and tourists visit distant natural surroundings brings negative effects. An important reason is that it is very dangerous to get access to these areas. Obviously, the terrain of these destination such as South Pole is extremly severe with ice, mountain even wild-threatening animal. If natural disasters occur including ice-melting or mountain landslide, people will be isolated or even killed due to the lack of transportation. Another reason is that for anyone who wants to do research in these regions, it is very difficult.

This new kind of traveling brings many merits in terms of tourism; however, I would firmly contend that its drawbacks may dwarf those short-term benefits.
On the one hand, the ability to travel everywhere in the world may offer the chance to discover new areas level the understanding of the mother land. These newfound pieces of knowledge can act as the key to helping the development of conservation programs. For instance, on-site scientists' research conducted in Antarctica illuminated the mating habitats of the emperor penguins, a nearly-extinct animal species. By close observation and initiatives driving in the natural areas, this team had doubled its fertility rate. In addition to this, the discovery of isolated regions may be a new trend for people who like journeying, it would boost the tourism economy in related areas.
On the other hand, these positive aspects of approaching inaccessible regions may be eclipsed by the threats it may pose in the environment on those lands. First of all, it is the pollution of visitors in the destination areas with littering, wasting, and other irresponsible behaviors. It may bring an imbalance in the ecosystem of creatures in these remote regions. Secondly, the threat of water contamination by using cruise ships or other forms of shipping transportation. For example, it is true that there was a cruise boat heading to the South Pole stuck by an iceberg, and then it sank down to the ocean floor with the diesel fuel spilling out. Despite of international efforts, it claimed the lives of thousands of sea creatures in a few weeks and eradicated the marine biodiversity around that area.
In conclusion, exploitation and extraction may bring benefits to the human population, but in charge, it also causes damage to ecosystems.

2124,25,Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age. Some think they should begin at least 7 years old. Discuss both views give opinions,"In the contemporary life, as competitiveness in the academic field has tremendously increased in intensity, whether children should engage in formal education as soon as possible or at the age of 7 at least is a topic of heated debate. While both proposals are promising in regard to children's academic development, there are more compelling grounds that kids should wait until reaching the age of 7 to start attending formal institutions.
Commencing their education at a relatively early age would be beneficial to children in some ways. It is commonly known that humans have a proclivity to reach their fullest potential of memorising and absorbing novel knowledge when they are in their formative years, and this capability tends to cease as they age. Therefore, having an early start in formal education is synonymous with being able to learn more swiftly and effortlessly. Moreover, since formal education is a uniform and well-structured system with legitimate, verified information, it is an extremely reliable source of knowledge to convey to young students. Attaining fundamental knowledge through such a standardised system from an early age makes it easier to for children to be righteously orient in their path to grow as a person.
Nevertheless, starting to go to formal schools at the age of seven would be more reasonable in regard to kids' necessary time and space for self-development in their formative years. As formal education often follows a strict and stiff framework, having to attend schools too soon will deprive young children of the much-needed opportunities to grow their signature limitless creativity and imagination. In addition to that, when kids reach the age of seven, they will have already been able to develop basic self-discipline, such as daily hygiene and respect for people around them. This will help teachers' jobs much less tiring as they do not have to carry the burden of teaching students such basic etiquettes anymore and can wholly concentrate on conveying the academic knowledge in class.

1574,4,Some people think that increasing communication usage of computers and mobile phones by young people has had a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nearly every day, billions of individuals use digital delivery techniques such as emails, text messaging, and virtual social networks to create and read messages. This looks to support reading and writing abilities at first glance. However, I feel that these forms of communication have a negative influence on a person's ability to read and write in general.
The most crucial reason for my viewpoint is the propensity to utilize an informal term in mobile and online conversations. While serious reading and writing require exposure to formal language, the majority of communications sent via mobile phones and computers are brief and contain spoken phrases. It is because, on a social channel, individuals prioritize time savings and convenience over the intricacy of their communication. Therefore, the more frequently people utilize a mobile or computer-based connection, the more probable informal phrases will predominate in their accent usage.
Another factor contributing to the deterioration of reading and writing ability is an over-reliance on technology. This is because spell-checked and automatic proofreading services are commonly used by mobile and computer users while drafting a message. A study clearly shows that a large number of websites and information on the Internet are often inaccurate, which has had negative consequences for children's behavior. Furthermore, certain products, such as Microsoft Office, are installed to automatically correct errors. Youth, on the other hand, do not have time to address the problem and are prone to making mistakes at other times. This erosion eventually causes both writing and reading abilities to degrade.

Firstly, one big problem in city life is the high cost of living. In other words, living in a big city cost is likely to be much higher than it is in a small town or village. Inhabitants in a city may help to pay higher price for eating, transport, rental house,...

In a place with high population, the risk of encountering a mob is much higher than that in a small town. It means that the victim of a crime in a big city may be everyone without an exception.
In my opinion, to tackle both the issues above, governments should promote the migration from urban areas to rural ones. By this way, the population density of metropolitan area is dramatically reduced, so do with cost of living and crime. However, many people dreams for city because of its high opportunities and better live standard. This is why government have to step in because only they can approve rural development policies.

1186,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"In recent years, it is observed that a number of young employees lack fundamental interpersonal skills such as teamwork. This problem can be attributed to some reasons including the education system and the inefficient training programs. It must be addressed by some definite measures such as changing the nature of academic training and providing extra activities in the working environment.
There are some certain factors why young employees do not possess utter collaborative skills. The most prominent reason is improper training in their previous educational environment. A myriad of colleges and universities nowadays tend to place more emphasis on training students' majors by theoretical knowledge rather than providing them fundamental skills. As a result, when students officially enter the workforce, they may find it difficult to communicate and collaborate with their co-workers regardless of their high academic levels. Another convincing reason is the nature of the workplace in this age of change. A number of companies tend to separate their working areas into different blocks or cubicles as the employers believe assigning their employees with particular types of missions and letting them finish by themselves can definitely guarantee the outcome of work. However, this action not only declines the relationship between colleagues since they rarely have the opportunities to discuss work-related subjects with each other but also limits collaboration skills.
A number of measures could be adopted to tackle the problem. The primary remedy is that school authorities should consider changing educational curricula to incorporate soft skills training. To be more specific, apart from compulsory subjects that students learn at school, they have the chance to engage themselves in job-oriented subjects which provide them with essential interpersonal skills related to teamwork and presentation. Another solution is that businesses should assign some special projects that allow staff, especially new recruits to work together. For instance, when an assignment has been done successfully with effective teamwork, the team members cannot only gasp the value of various experiences that are gained from the group work but also have more chances to interact with colleagues.
In summary, the shortage of interpersonal skills in new recruits could be explained by the wrongly oriented academic curricular and the development in the nature of the workplace.

3573,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"It can easily be seen these days that the younger generations are more aware of pop music and famous stars from other countries rather than historical figures from their own places. This can be ascribed to the growth of the Internet and its effects to people interest, but also some actions need to be taken to solve this problem.
A major reason to why young people are more interested in famous movies and music stars is that social media has become one of our main resources to be informed about lately. With the development of technology, the youth are more likely to surf the Internet and find articles about a movie that just came out or a singer who just released their latest album. For instance, we can easily find thousands of reviews and articles with headlines about "" Avengers: Endgame "" but not that much about Neils Bohr and Rutherford. From the perspective of young people, they are often more attracted to catchy songs, fancy images of celebrities than some boring black and white documentaries about people in the history. As a result, youngsters will know about international pop and movies stars more.
In order to help the younger generations to learn about famous people from the past in their own country, we can enhance their knowledge by producing films with historical theme. On Netflix-one of the most popular movie streaming service these days, there are a variety of great historical movies, such as "" Mudbound "", "" Enola Holmes "", "" Rose Island ""... and for Korean drama lovers there are "" Empress Ki "", "" Taxi Driver "", "" Youth of May "",...

This can be ascribed to the growth of the Internet and its effects to people interest, but also some actions need to be taken to solve this problem. A major reason to why young people are more interested in famous movies and music stars is that social media has become one of our main resources to be informed about lately. With the development of technology, the youth are more likely to surf the Internet and find articles about a movie that just came out or a singer who just released their latest album. For instance, we can easily find thousands of reviews and articles with headlines about "" Avengers: Endgame "" but not that much about Neils Bohr and Rutherford. From the perspective of young people, they are often more attracted to catchy songs, fancy images of celebrities than some boring black and white documentaries about people in the history. As a result, youngsters will know about international pop and movies stars more. In order to help the younger generations to learn about famous people from the past in their own country, we can enhance their knowledge by producing films with historical theme. On Netflix-one of the most popular movie streaming service these days, there are a variety of great historical movies, such as "" Mudbound "", "" Enola Holmes "", "" Rose Island ""... and for Korean drama lovers there are "" Empress Ki "", "" Taxi Driver "", "" Youth of May "",...

Up to a point, the craze for entertainment of society and the archaic teaching method are worthy of people's concern. To begin with, the mass media tend to sensationalize scandals with non-transparency information to draw the attention of viewers.

There are benefits of the act of finding out natural surroundings.

Consequently, the remote natural environment will bring their emotion up, for example with wildlife, unique plants and animals that they just have seen on digital media.

3373,13,Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Given the increasing industry market rivalry, it might seem that people tend to prefer working for a company instead of having their own business. From my point of view, I advocate self-employment choice better than a job.
Firstly, being self-employed allows people to do various things flexibly and dynamically. Therefore, it gives more work satisfaction than work for a company because people can freely adopt exciting domains and hours of work. Thanks to an initiative at work and flexible time, people can practice their work for the sake of their pleasure and not depend on someone else. For example, people can take time off whenever they want perhaps work anywhere if work is available. It is quite suitable for women with very young children because they badly need to manage their work as well as family life.
Secondly, self-employment might permit a person to be boss and have endless financial possibilities. People might earn more money if they worked hard while people working for others will get only a constant salary. Therefore, the financial growth of self-employed people is in their own hands and they can increase it by working hard. For instance, a trader of a multi-national company never gets a share of the profit which he begets by selling products, but an entrepreneur has the privilege to have the whole profit for theirs.
In conclusion, the self-ventures possibility is better than working for a company because it not only allows a person to work independently but also gives creative liberty to arrange suitable working conditions. In addition, the earnings are proportional to the hard-working and effort, which is a positive inspiration for people.",0,"Given the increasing industry market rivalry, it might seem that people tend to prefer working for a company instead of having their own business.

3419,25,Some people think that children should begin their formal education at a very early age. Some think they should begin at least 7 years old. Discuss both views give opinions,"Whether kids should receive formal learning at such a young age has always been a divisive topic. Regarding this matter, some people argue that a structured and systematic form of learning should not be provided before children are seven years old, whilst others say the opposite. Although the former way of thinking is valid to some certain extent, I opine that children should enter formal education until they reach the age of seven.
On the one hand, it is understandable why some people subscribe to the view that kids should get formal schooling before their seventh birthday. The main rationale is that from birth to the first few years of life is one of the most critical periods in child development. Children's brains form connections faster in the first five years than at any other time so it is perfect to expose them to an educational setting. Additionally, structured education offers kids essential literacy and mathematic skills. They will thus have a rudimental knowledge of word recognition and number awareness, which is a fantastic first step on their way to higher education. However, this thinking fails to account for that if not thoroughly monitored in school, the child can form unwanted habits such as fighting or bullying. Because at such a very tender age, kids are more likely to imitate bad behaviour, they can learn aggressive behaviours by observing other friends. Therefore, children should not begin formal schooling very early
On the other hand, there are compelling reasons why children should delay their entrance to formal learning until the age of seven. Delaying structured education provides mental health benefits to children, allowing them to better self-regulate their attention and hyperactivity levels when they do start school. For example, in Finland or Sweden, formal academic education does not start until the age of 7, when children are deemed to be mentally and physically ready for the challenge, though these countries are known for high-achieving kids.
In conclusion, although entering formal education at an early age benefits children's essential skills, I contend that there are overwhelming advantages of starting formal learning until seven. It is recommended that the child's main way of learning and developing is through, which allows her to explore, observe, experiment, solve problems and learn from her mistakes.",0,"Whether kids should receive formal learning at such a young age has always been a divisive topic.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The role of the government in banning extreme sports issues is a major topic of concern in today's world. While it is believed that people have multiple choices in sport or activities, there is compelling evidence that the government cannot interfere in individual sports
There is a common belief that some extreme sports should be banned by the government. Some kinds of sports such as surfing, racing, rock climbing, and so on, which can make the player get risks or maybe potentially life-threatening. For example, in the research in 2010, the number of people who were killed by sharks when surfing is approximately twelve thousand, and 80% of them were dead. Moreover, Boxing and wrestling should be forbidden by the government as they can lead to violent thoughts in children. Various studies are being performed and the harvest results found that 78% of children who watch extreme sport has bad behavior at school and it can make children more hungry for success.
However, there are more reasonable grounds that people should have the freedom to do any sports or activity. Nowadays, the player has some protective equipment to ensure that they cannot get injured when playing extreme sport. For instance, there have companies produce specialized tools for racers such as helmets, racing suits, which protect their head and their body by seriously colliding. They have their right to do whatever they want and the government should respect their favor. In Australia in 2008, an amateur surfer had been bitten by a shark then she had to cut one arm, however, when she completely recovered her strength, she kept standing on her surfboard and take part in some competitions and she had the first gold medal in 2013.

Therefore, immigrants have to learn many of new rules before they come to a new country. Another major drawback is the price could be higher.

This is because, they experience the darkest time in prison where they are behaved cruely, such as being bullied and being slaves of some prisoners who are the leaders in that place, resulting in many injuries on their bodies. When they come back to society, citizens will isolate and critic them because they are consider that those people will commit crimes again. Consequently, ex-prisoners have to suffer from the injuries not only on their bodies but also in their mental. Ex-offenders in Asia, for example, suffers from critisms received from society and memorize the time when they were servants in prison, so that some of them choose suicide and others become autism.
Apart from communicating to school students from experience, they are the only ones who can perceive what teenagers who intend to commit a crime are thinking, and give them advice to become examplary citizens.

On the one hand, discovering distant natural places is advantageous in a few ways. This is first because it is more interesting to have the opportunity to experience new places.

On the other hand, there are some disadvantages I saw to this trend. If visitors are not well-prepared carefully, they can be risky. Traveling to woodlands can also be hazardous since people can be at risk of being attacked by animals or natural disasters. Another reason is that humans can pollute and destroy the homes of a variety of living species without realizing it.

On the other hand, I am firmly convinced that there are other viable measures to educate about the danger of partaking in criminal activities. Since learning about the drastic consequences of crime is now of utmost necessity in today's world, one of the most suitable is to introduce criminology as a subject in the curriculum.

That why governments should extend their view and action not only on native, but foreigner as well. Firstly, the world's leaders bear hesitation over the provision of international aids to deprived regions. Firstly, it is unachieveable for government's support to reach all of the poor region as their number is enormous and scattered around the world and the support they need also differ. For example, developed nations may encounter obtacles transportation of food and medicines to unwealthy regions around Africa and Indian. Secondly, I believe leaders will prioritize the well-being of their own citizens and stablity of their economy and politics situation before global assistance. On the other hand, I believe governments should help as many people as they possible regardless of challenges. To begin with, in many underdeveloped countries, they are unable to recover aftermath an disater, for example, terrorist attack or heavy earth quake. Also of great benefit is that this national act of charity could have a huge impression upon helped people. If the government take actions to help other nation, citizens of that country will idolize the idea of self-devotion toward a better world. In conlusion, although it's impossible to achive global peace for a singular government, they could still help by contribute by little efforts, which when combined in mass, will become a great progession.",1704,307,13,4.671009771986971,74,75,30,36,13

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In this day and age, it is easier for people to travel to natural places that are rural, for example the South Pole. Like two sides of the same coin, being able to go to these remote areas entails both advantages and disadvantages. From my perspective, I would argue that this development has more drawbacks which need to be considered than the positive aspects.
It is true that people cannot stop the ambition of exploring new places, especially the scientists who want to know more about Mother Earth. They would love to be in an isolated area such as the South or North Pole looking for documentation of new species. Moreover, there are many people who are adventurous and start losing their interest in travelling to other cities or countries who would like to challenge themselves in another destination such as the Sahara Desert or Amazon Rainforest.
However, the more people coming to these rural destinations the more damage it will have. Most of these remote natural places are pristine and can easily be harmed so that if there are many scientists or travellers, it can cause detrimental effects on the habitat and the animals living there. Furthermore, in order to be at such uncommon areas like the South or North Pole, people need a variety of preparations, for instance, good physical condition, insurance, and so on. In addition, the price can put it out of reach of many people and going to these remote natural environment involves many unexpected situations which can harm yourself or at worst lead to death.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, it can be seen that there is a huge amount of advertisement that targets children, and some people think that it should be forbidden. In my personal opinion, I agree that the government should ban such advertising activities because it contains a lot of harmful contexts that could affect young people badly.
A significant disadvantage of aiming advertisements at children is that they could face such contents that could manipulate children's minds to believe what the advertiser shows them but not what they learn from their parent's education. This could lead to conflicts between parents and children if they deny what children told them about what they have seen in the advertisements.
Not only that, those advertisements contents usually appear on television or on smartphones, which are really harmful to young people's health. These days, various fast food company direct their marketing strategies toward children, they make their food look so tasty and healthy.

For example, Kfc or Mcdonald's has a lot of mouthwatering pictures that make people just want to buy their food immediately but they do not know that behind those pictures and videos is a bunch of edits so they could look that way.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In modern days, that people go cycling less now than in the past has become a major source of concern in wealthier countries. There are various causes behind this phenomenon, and governments should implement several remedies to improve the situation.
There are two major explanations for this problem. Bicycles, for starters, are inconvenient in comparison to other modes of transportation such as motorbikes and automobiles. This could be explained by the fact that bikes require human strength to move rather than being mechanized by the engine. As a result, they are not a good option for long-distance travelers. Another key reason is that most infrastructure throughout the world does not have dedicated bike lanes. This is due to the fact that most highways are constructed to accommodate the great demand for other modes of transportation.
Fortunately, several measures could be taken by authorities to alleviate this problem. First of which is conducting monthly green days in order to encourage more people to go cycling. This might be accomplished by prohibiting citizens from using motorized vehicles and allowing them to only commute by bicycle. The second solution is that the governments should allocate more money for the construction of cycling paths. In Germany, for example, the number of people riding bicycles has increased dramatically after new bike lanes were built.

410,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"There is a reduction in using bicycles as a main mean of transport nowadays. This problem arre posed by the raising of other transportations and the exercise demands of people. This situation needs to be tackled by encouraging people to cycle for saving nonrenewable resources by the goverment.
On the one hand, the uncommon use of bicycles has caused by a number of consequences. With the highly demand of a fast and cheap mean of transports, people prefer driving motorbike and car or using public transportation to driving bicycle. Public transportation not only has a affordable price but also do not cost your strength instead of going by bike. Furthermore, people today do not interested in taking exercise because of being busy. They will take a walk if they only want to stay healthy or going to the gym for a better body instead of taking bicycle.
On the other hand, there are some solutions which can be adopted to address the the decreasing in using bike. The goverment should have action in calling people to limit their personal transportation to protect the environment. Facing up to the shortage of raw materials in the near future such as coal, fuel and gas, using environmentally friendly mean of transport as bike is suggested. Moreover, using bicycle can also limit the exhausted gas which can be harmful to the environment. In addition, goverment should organize more bike competition from small to bigger area to advise citizen to cycle more.
In conclusion, the replaceable of other transportations and the change of peole exercise purpose have posed the falling of taking bicycle.

1238,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Cycling is known as a better way to protect the environment and improve physical health than any other type of vehicles. In recent years, the number of people using bicycles has been experiencing a downward trend. This is due to some certain reasons, and there are several solutions that could be applied to motivate people to use their bike more often.
There are 2 main reasons for the uncommon of using bicycle. The first issue to be mentioned is bike riding is physically demanding and time-consuming. Whereas people in our modern society prefer to live with the convenient and fast-flow lifestyle. Therefore, vehicles run by fuels or electricity are widely chosen for their journey whether long or short. Compared with other means of transport, bicycle is much slower and not comfortable. Another issue is that there are not any cycling paths in many countries. That means people have to ride a bike in the same lane with other transportation, -which may lead to dangerous situations and accidents. In Vietnam, some people even ride on the pavements which are only for pedestrians. It is because they are scared of being injured when traveling on the main roads with cars and motorbikes.
To boost the use of bicycle, several actions can be implemented. First of all, government should impose higher taxes on owning motor vehicles as well as fuels to raise their prices, thereby discouraging people from using gasoline engine vehicle and urging them to shift to riding bicycle. As a result, people may choose bicycle as their primary method of transport as they can save more money. Moreover, cycling paths should be constructed in every regions. There should be the clear lane division for different means of transport including vehicles run by engine and bicycle. So that, citizens would be safer and feel more comfortable when travelling.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","In a number of countries, more and more miniature shops, which are located in the city, are going to stop business because of the preference of driving to the suburbs to shop at sizeable boutiques. This leads to a number of outcomes, including an increased of using cars and a limited trend to shop for those without cars. In my opinion, this change does more harm than good.
From an overall perspective, there are some benefits of doing shopping on the outskirts of some countries. First, the population density is balanced. As a consequence, the housing supply systems are possibly relieved pressure and some issue such as lack of water and overload of electricity can be solved.

While numerous people assert that children should embark on formal education when they are small, others consider that they should study after 7 years old.

On the one hand, the schooling of children helps kids approach various domains such as Mathematics, Geography or Literature which require critical thinking and intensive studies. Hence, they will attain a comprehensive education when they are little. Besides that, children who start learning early will have more time to process academic knowledge step by step from grasping to analyzing data than those beginning late. Therefore, they will have a chance to prepare for their future more meticulously and thoroughly than others.
On the other hand, only when children are 7 years old, should they access structured and systematic education in light of several reasons. Initially, kids are unable to differentiate between true and false information before 7 years old since their brains do not develop enough. Consequently, they will think wrongly when growing up. Secondly, the young studying at an early age will lose their innocence and childlike qualities. To exemplify, they have to accomplish homework, worry about continuous examinations and compete with peers to get high scores rather than play freely and happily. As a consequence, kids will be under pressure as they are too young.

In addition, the number of visitors can increase significantly is conducive to prompt economic advancement stemming from traveling development to the remote natural environment. However, I believe that the disadvantages of such a thing far outweigh the benefits. Traveling to a remote natural environment can destroy the ordinary ecosystem of animals here, for instance, at the South Pole, if everybody visits where the situation of polar bears and other creatures, these things take risks to make limit life conditions for creatures and animals. Moreover, transporting to this area consumes too much fuel gives rise to environmental problems. Finally, such traveling has a substantial drawback of creating environment and accommodation issues for animals and the ecosystem. In summary, traveling to a remote natural place is associated with many shortcomings which far outweigh the benefits.",1481,250,11,5.032,61,59,30,40,18

For start with, some people have the intention of being their own boss. They prefer this decision because they don't like to be monitored or regulated and follow the rules of the companies. Next, they also want to become self-reliant so that they can easily arrange their time and feel free. Moreover, they want to find a wide range of relationships so that they can build a popular network that brings credibility. With that trust, they will easily receive the investment of relationships.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Due to the advancement of technology, the way people write and read has changed tremendously compared to the past. While it is asserted that the rise of communication usage of computers and phones by youngsters has exerted a detrimental impact on their writing and reading skills, I firmly believe that this trend is beneficial to these skills of the young.
On the one hand, there is a common belief that these skills are adversely affected as people depend excessively on the Internet. Some apps that people derive benefits from are gradually destroying people reading and writing skills due to their convenience. For example, some apps which allow people to correct mistakes and find the appropriate words to express their ideas when people write can make them become more likely to make mistakes when there is no assistance to rely on. Consequently, communication usage of computers and phones can play wreak havoc on people's reading and writing skills in the long run.
On the other hand, there is a more persuasive argument that the communication usage of digital devices and mobile phones has made the way people generate ideas and practice reading become easier. There is a host of online newspapers and blogs that can help people develop these skills. Vn Express, for instance, is one of the online websites that adolescents in Viet Nam can access to read the latest news and better their writing skills. As a result, if young people can capitalize on their digital devices and phones in an accurate way, they will have windows of opportunities to improve these skills.
In summary, although it is hypothesized that the use of computers and mobile phones of the young has had an adverse impact on their reading and writing skills, there is more compelling evidence that such a trend has brought benefits to many people, including the young. In the future, this development is expected to be more prevalent and useful so that it can help even more people.",0,"Due to the advancement of technology, the way people write and read has changed tremendously compared to the past.

2074,0,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There is currently an upward trend in the number of people playing extreme sports around the world, and what comes with it is the rise in injury cases and death cases. This raised a controversial question that whether the governments should ban these kinds of sports. Some people believe that dangerous sports should be forbidden due to their inherently risky nature. However, this argument is invalid and therefore, cannot justify the act of infringing the freedom of choice. Despite the dangers that extreme sports cause to their players, the government should never completely ban them because people have the right to choose whatever sports they want.
There is a prevalent belief that dangerous sports such as mountaineering, skydiving, or boxing should not be allowed as they have a high chance of injury and death. Boxers, for instance, are inevitably wounded and exposed to the high risk of permanent damages after every match as throwing punches at opponents is a dispensable part of this sport. Yet, this argument is invalid for two reasons. The primary reason is that avoiding risks and dangers is not a rational action by definition but a behavior that is suitable for the majority, who are risk-averse and prefer not involving in dangers. People choose what to play by match the sports characteristics with their preferences. As a result, people who are interested in danger and risky activities seek extreme sports, vice versa. Therefore, it would be undoubtedly unfair for the minority, who are risk-lover, to be compelled to avoid risk like the risk-averse. Another reason is that since all sports involve risks and danger to some degree, it is difficult the determine the threshold above which a sport is considered an extreme sport.
It is important that people are at the liberty to play the sport that they want, despite their dangerous attributes. To begin with, the governments have no appropriate reason to curtail the freedom of sports choice because the acts of play extreme sports neither cause dangers to anyone besides its owners nor create any social vices. A skydiver, for example, might render his family worry as he attempts to jump off a plane from a high altitude but the act of skydiving itself does not harm anyone else. Furthermore, extreme sports are not the only dangerous thing that people use to entertain themself. Alcohol and fast foods are being consumed by millions of people around the world knowing the fact these things have deleterious effects on their bodies. If people have to autonomy to choose whatever foods and drinks they want, then this autonomy should be extended to sports as well.
In conclusion, although extreme sports are dangerous to their player and can lead to serious consequences, the government should never completely ban these kinds of sport as it would intrude on the right of people to play whatever sports they want. It is recommended that governments establish high standards that players are required to meet and limitations to reduce the risks and dangers in extreme sports.",0,"There is currently an upward trend in the number of people playing extreme sports around the world, and what comes with it is the rise in injury cases and death cases.

However, in big cities, when the pressure of population was increased too fast and too much, people living in here have to face with a lot of negative problems, some of them has effect badly on our health. This essay will highlight some problems that people often face when living in big cities.
First, the biggest problem when living in big cities is traffic congestion. The population growth, while the the quality of roads and bridges has not been improved, it will lead to traffic jams, especially at peak hours such as time after work and school. Specially, on rainy days, with poor roads quality, weak drainage system leading to flooding in some roads, traffic congestion becomes much more serious. Traveling in a short distance usually takes a long time, sometimes up to an hour, causing fatigue and stress both physically and mentally for everyone. Therefore, government and urban administration should have inventions to solve this problem, including adjusting people's working and school time, upgrade, improve and expand the system of bridges and roads, encourage people to use convenient public transport, develop the subway and skytrain system, for example in the city where I live now, Hanoi, is conducting a free ticket to everyone and collecting people's opinions about the Cat Linh-Ha Dong metro system, before use this system. It is also an effective measure to encourage people to use more different types of public transport, minimizing private vehicles.

Mental and physical health problems are no longer and uncommon problems, on the contrary, they tend to increase among young people. Unsafe living conditions, living in cramped areas (due to in big cities, the price to buy or rent houses with a large area is very expensive), will adversely affect to our health. It is one of the reasons that in recent years, depression in young people tends to increase. We need to adjust our living and study modes, practice physical or mental health exercises..

One the one hand, the internet supports people to improve productivity in working and studying. In fact, it provides access to much information for anything and it also has lots of software which helps us advertise, designing and keep in touch with other companies. Moreover, in daily life, everything becomes more easily by applying the internet. For example, people can buy food and services from the comfort of their home, so people have more time to do their work or relaxing. On the other hand, the popularity of the internet makes lots of problems for the user. Especially those having children, parents find it difficult to control what their children see online. In other words, they do not always know who their children are chatting. Moreover, with so many websites it is difficult to search for good information and criminals increasingly use the internet to steal people's money. These make people spending time to select correct information and legal items In conclusion, there are several disadvantages of using the internet but also the internet has made life so much easier in so many ways.",1342,253,12,4.4229249011857705,66,64,19,40,17

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","With the technological advancements, there is often much debate around the fact that scientists and visitors want to go off the beaten track natural environments. While this trend may bring about some benefits, I would argue they are eclipsed by the drawbacks.
On one side of the argument, there are many who claim that scientists and travelers contribute to the natural environment has a number of advantages. First and foremost, when they go to distant as the South Pole. They will learn more about the habitat of many species for example Penguins, which live far away from humans, and also to accumulate knowledge to clinical breakthroughs to deal with environmental issues. Secondly, journeyers, who will be found a new place to throw parties or even picnic, as a result, they will feel at ease after a long time working.
Despite these attractions, several drawbacks of going to distant can create environmental pollution. This might be explained by the fact that people's lack of environmental awareness can be brought up a number of problems such as water pollution, climate change and a thing that plays a vital role is ice from deep layer melt, which also creates more pandemic. These are urgent problems on Earth if left unfixed will lead to catastrophic consequences. In addition to this, when people come from far away, the locals will feel a lack of home and not relax, more important that is increase sea level can make people near sea coast have to immigrate, this can contribute to home loss and illegal immigration.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In temporary life, the demand for communication is increasing inexorably; therefore, the advent of online platforms, which allow ordinary people to have inferior access to interact worldwide makes a paradigm shift in the way they communicate. However, there are some individuals who are of the opinion that the phenomenon has an adverse bearing on their reading and writing abilities. I firmly believe that the drawbacks of virtual conversation are definitely significant.
The detrimental effects of communicating through digital devices on the way adolescents read are palpable. Firstly, the continual exposure to blue light from electronic gadgets takes a heavy toll on their eyesight. As a consequence, users can easily be vulnerable to short-sightedness and have to wear glasses from a very young age, which is inevitably inconvenient. Moreover, this way of communication can cause social media addiction since it offers a wide range of entertainment to the young. This can be seen that children will be indifferent to their inherent study process and eschew the habit of reading books which leads to compounded reading skills.
In terms of writing abilities, online communications also trigger far-reaching consequences for young people, especially the preteens as their literacy skills are not developed. The foremost impact is the growing popularity of slang and teen code, which causes children to get used to abbreviation forms of words; thus, they may use those at their disposal even in the formal context or in their literature essay. As the result, children's academic performances would be significantly compromised. In addition, the excessive use of the keyboard and phone to type or message makes adolescents forget how to write properly. This can worsen if they forget how to spell a simple word in their mother tongue.
In conclusion, the human desire for greater convenience and the ability to communicate worldwide regardless of geographic boundaries is the key driving force behind the availability of online platforms to exchange information.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Whether governments should help people outside of their countries is emerging as a mjaor topic of concern today. From my point of view, I contend that despite how unachievable this idea may seem, the governmental support should not focus only on the locals.
To begin with, in this modern world, it is significant to understand that people are living in a dynamic society, where one action can affect various others. Hence, to promote sustainable development, each government will need to take major problems of global citizens into consideration. For example, for the environmental issues, people in authorities around the world need to form cross-sectoral policies to somehow slow down the effect of global warming. The growing heat of the Earth cannot be eased with just a sole country's action but the whole world. In addition, in many underdeveloped countries, the heads do not have the ability to support their own people, which calls for the assisstance from the affluent countries. Considering the humanity, developing nations should not ignore the issues. In return, countries can raise their reputation for taking actions to help people overseas.
On the other hand, I still believe that a country's citizens should be its first priority. Before helping other nations, the nations' leaders need to stabilize their own economy and politics first. Besides, it is impossible to help everyone of poor and unpriviliged class around the world as the number is unaccountable and their needs varies. For example, in some parts of Africa, the majority of the population are suffering from famine while in other parts, people are struggling with diseases.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that technological advances have made communication more convenient and immediate. While I partly agree that these modern devices cause some adverse effects on young people's reading and writing ability, I believe that they also bring several benefits to such skills.
On the one hand, high-tech gadgets such as computers and cellphones may lead to deteriorating reading and writing skills. The first reason for my belief is the reliance on technological assistance. Some computer programs offer users proofreading services and auto-correct options such as Grammarly or Ginger to check the spelling or grammatical mistakes of the documents. While those actions could facilitate the writing process, they may impair the precision in lexical items and sentences structures when composing a text documents. Furthermore, young generation have a tendency to use abbreviations and slang terms when they have a chat with friends. Hence, as academic writing and reading contain formal language with a wide range of complex sentence forms, youngsters who overuse cyber communication can apply such expressions to their language usage.
On the other hand, the appropriate use of modern devices could acquire language skills. As the Internet contains a large number of websites with useful information, young people can access numerous valuable reading sources, for example, some reliable electronic papers such as The Guardian, Forbes, or The New York Times. Due to those digital platforms, youngsters might develop good reading habits on daily basis, thus may enrich their vocabularies and sharpen their reading comprehension skills.

While I partly agree that these modern devices cause some adverse effects on young people's reading and writing ability, I believe that they also bring several benefits to such skills. On the one hand, high-tech gadgets such as computers and cellphones may lead to deteriorating reading and writing skills. The first reason for my belief is the reliance on technological assistance. Some computer programs offer users proofreading services and auto-correct options such as Grammarly or Ginger to check the spelling or grammatical mistakes of the documents. While those actions could facilitate the writing process, they may impair the precision in lexical items and sentences structures when composing a text documents. Furthermore, young generation have a tendency to use abbreviations and slang terms when they have a chat with friends. Hence, as academic writing and reading contain formal language with a wide range of complex sentence forms, youngsters who overuse cyber communication can apply such expressions to their language usage. On the other hand, the appropriate use of modern devices could acquire language skills. As the Internet contains a large number of websites with useful information, young people can access numerous valuable reading sources, for example, some reliable electronic papers such as The Guardian, Forbes, or The New York Times. Due to those digital platforms, youngsters might develop good reading habits on daily basis, thus may enrich their vocabularies and sharpen their reading comprehension skills. Moreover, they may also possess the ability to connect the ideas and manage all aspects of cohesion well, which might help enhance their writing skills.

4569,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Cycling has long been an excellent way to improve health and save the environment in every country. However, in these modern days, there is a tendency for using motor vehicles instead of bike as modes of transport. It is mainly because these kinds of transport are not as convenient as modern ones. To make traveling by bicycle more appealing to residents, the government should improve the infrastructure and impose high taxes on motor vehicles.
There are several reasons as to why citizens hesitate to choose bike as a mode of transportation. One important reason is people have an over-reliance on modern means of transport such as cars and motorcycles. It is because these kinds of transport are more convenient and suitable for long journeys, especially for those who often spend a great deal of time commuting from their home to the workplace. Moreover, in some developing countries, there is a shortage of dedicated cycling paths for cyclists. Consequently, those who wish to transit by bicycle have to use the same lane as motor vehicles, which is dangerous.
Several measures can be implemented to raise the cyclist rate. An obvious remedy is a very high tax should be imposed on motor vehicles. This can discourage people from using modern vehicles, thus encouraging them to switch to bicycles. For instance, to decrease the number of citizens using cars and motorbikes, the Korean government applies a high ratio of tax for such transports. Another solution is that government should invest more money in the infrastructure of cycling paths for citizens. An excellent example of this solution is the Netherlands has many dedicated cycle lanes for exclusive use by cyclists. As a result, cycling is a common mode of transport in this country, with 36 percent of Dutch residents listing the bicycle as their most frequent way of traveling.
In conclusion, there are a few reasons why using bicycles is uninteresting to a majority of citizens in some countries, including the fact that the infrastructure does not meet the needs of most people. There are some solutions to encourage more people to use this means of transport, such as investing more in the construction of cycling paths for citizens.",0,"Cycling has long been an excellent way to improve health and save the environment in every country.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Due to the rapid advancement of technology, it is now achievable for scientists and travelers to set foot in isolated regions. While there are potential advantages of these activities, traveling to wild areas is associated with a number of drawbacks which far outweigh the benefits.
On the one hand, there are some reasons to believe that expeditions to unpopulated destinations are beneficial. One of the most noteworthy benefits is that while traveling to distant areas, both scientists and tourists have the chance to be knowledgeable about the natural ecosystem, meteorology, archaeology, etc. Indeed, those explorations have assisted scientists to recognize the situation of many nearly-extinct animal species as well as other natural issues such as ice melting in Antarctica, so that they can take immediate measures to solve the problems. Besides, by visiting unspoiled regions instead of common ones, it is more exciting for the travelers to explore new places and gain unforgettable memories and priceless experiences.
On the other hand, there are more considerable disadvantages to having expeditions to remote areas. The first one is that going to isolated destinations requires a large amount of expenditure and is risky in case the travelers are not well-prepared. Places like the South pole or Amazon rainforest have adverse effects on people's safety and health due to their hazardous environment and dangerous creatures. As a result, the cost of expeditions, which includes research facilities and safety ensuring fees, is undoubtedly high. A more significant drawback is that human access to wild regions is likely to disturb the ecological balance. Surveys show that some of the expeditions have done substantial damage to biodiversity of unique environments such as water contamination due to oil spills, deforestation, or even the extinction of some animal species. Some individuals' lack of environmental awareness has caused those permanent degradations to fragile ecosystems.
In conclusion, although expedition to unpopulated regions is advantageous in a few ways, the drawbacks of this trend are more serious to consider.

2790,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In this modern era, it has been argued that bicycles are becoming obsolete because people tend to neglect this means of transport. I would argue that there are some principal factors contributing to this issue and firmly believe that appropriate measures can be taken to address this problem.
The predominant reason is attributed to the fact that people these days are more over-dependence on modern transportation in lieu of cycling. As a matter of fact, in this contemporary epoch, people often have hectic schedules so if they wanted to save time as possible, they would use faster forms of transports such as motorbike and car for their needs. Another factor that proves this problem is that bicycles are operated by physical strength. Thus, with a sedentary lifestyle people would not use it for their transport. For example, on a hot and sunny day or when they have to travel a long-distance journey, people would inevitably choose another form of transportations, instead of bicycles.
Nevertheless, this worrying phenomenon can be tackled by adopting several actions. The first and foremost solution is that only by adapting to raising heavy taxes on modern transportation can the government mitigate the problem. Therefore, people who want to save money would choose bicycles for their main means of transport. Due to the fact that environmental degradation would be curbed. Another solution is that the state should construct more lanes to serve only cyclists. To illustrate, in Vietnam, the number of accidents of cyclists by car are being warned. Hence, they should be protected by owning their lanes. As a result, this activity might encourage people to travel faster with bicycles.
In summary, bicycles are becoming ignored in today's world and have exerted a number of adverse impacts on society, so strong remedies should be adopted to ameliorate this situation. It is predicted that unless these remedies are adopted, these problems associated with society will continue to persist in the future.",0,"In this modern era, it has been argued that bicycles are becoming obsolete because people tend to neglect this means of transport.

While that can also be partially solved, it is far from being the best remedy to discourage students from committing crimes.
Listening to real and vivid stories will probably have a significant effect because teenagers are more likely to take counsel from someone with experience. Young people can learn from reformed criminals about how they got into crime, the perils of living a criminal lifestyle, and what it's truly like inside bars. They can also remove any notions among kids that prisoners live glitzy lives.

Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Educating school students on the consequence of committing a crime has long been a contentious issue. Although there are a few reasons why people want to allow ex-prisoners to have a conversation with students about the dangers of carrying out illegal activities, there are more reasonable grounds that there are better methods to educate teenagers about the adverse effects of crime.
There are certain benefits of having reformed criminals talking to students about the hazards associated with crime. One important reason is that students may learn from those who fully understand crime and gather knowledge about the dangers of crime for the victims. This means that rehabilitated offenders have experience about the harsh environment in prison life as well as the types of criminals they encountered, which discourages teenagers from committing a crime and become a good citizens. Another reason is that if adolescents are advised by a real-life lesson of reformed criminals, this practice will have a powerful impact on the their mindset. Consequently, the youth become more cautious about the hypothetical consequences of partaking in criminals activities.
However, I am convinced that there are better solution to teach students about the adverse effects of participating in illegal activities. The most viable measure may be introducing criminology as a subject at school. This is because criminology knowledge have played a significant role in legal systems for decades, not only it is based on empirical data but also such a well-researched learning resources for students to discover. As a result, the adolescents will have a deeper insight into different perspectives of crime and the associated dangers compared to anecdotal experience of ex-prisoners which often tends to be biased. In addition to this, the government should establish a law enforcement system to promote awareness to teenagers about the severe consequences of involving in crime. If the political system adopts this method, the rate of teenage criminals will decrease substantially.
In conclusion, while allowing ex-prisoners to raise awareness about the dangers of committing a crime to students is beneficial, there are more reasonable grounds that the government should adopt more practical methods such as introducing criminology as a subjects and raising awareness to students by establishing new laws.",0,"Educating school students on the consequence of committing a crime has long been a contentious issue. Although there are a few reasons why people want to allow ex-prisoners to have a conversation with students about the dangers of carrying out illegal activities, there are more reasonable grounds that there are better methods to educate teenagers about the adverse effects of crime. There are certain benefits of having reformed criminals talking to students about the hazards associated with crime. One important reason is that students may learn from those who fully understand crime and gather knowledge about the dangers of crime for the victims. This means that rehabilitated offenders have experience about the harsh environment in prison life as well as the types of criminals they encountered, which discourages teenagers from committing a crime and become a good citizens. Another reason is that if adolescents are advised by a real-life lesson of reformed criminals, this practice will have a powerful impact on the their mindset. Consequently, the youth become more cautious about the hypothetical consequences of partaking in criminals activities. However, I am convinced that there are better solution to teach students about the adverse effects of participating in illegal activities. The most viable measure may be introducing criminology as a subject at school. This is because criminology knowledge have played a significant role in legal systems for decades, not only it is based on empirical data but also such a well-researched learning resources for students to discover. As a result, the adolescents will have a deeper insight into different perspectives of crime and the associated dangers compared to anecdotal experience of ex-prisoners which often tends to be biased. In addition to this, the government should establish a law enforcement system to promote awareness to teenagers about the severe consequences of involving in crime. If the political system adopts this method, the rate of teenage criminals will decrease substantially. In conclusion, while allowing ex-prisoners to raise awareness about the dangers of committing a crime to students is beneficial, there are more reasonable grounds that the government should adopt more practical methods such as introducing criminology as a subjects and raising awareness to students by establishing new laws.",2388,391,14,5.173913043478261,96,104,35,65,16
1279,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"Lack of basic interpersonal skills in new employees is considered to be a major topic of concern in today's world. While this trend could cause some significant problems for both the economically competitive market and business, some measures could be adopted to tackle them.
There are some compelling reasons why the lack of basic interpersonal skills could produce adverse effects on the economy of the country's business. One of the most compelling reasons is that real-life experiences and interpersonal skills are not required at academic institutions. Students may not have their knowledge about the abilities in cooperation that is required for careers due to the teaching methods of teachers and theories provided at academic institutions. Theories students learnt at school are totally different from reality and almost all academic knowledge is nos required in normal life and the teachers' teaching methods focus only on having flying colors and achieving professional qualifications. Given the fact that many students nowadays are focusing only on studying academic subjects and they are not sufficiently prepared for their cooperation skills. Furthermore, the design of the modern workplace might also be the precursor of the problem. Particularly, as an organisation develops, its employees are more likely to be given their own cubicles and assigned with more specific parts of their work, which reduces the chances for their staff to exchange words. In some companies, employees are divided into departments and work in small separate spaces or cubicles, in which each member is assigned particular tasks unrelated to their colleagues. Opportunities to share experience or exchange work related subjects arise so that teamwork skills may not be developed.
However, there are some solutions that could be implemented to mitigate the problems that arise. Given the aforementioned, schools and universities should make changes in their curricula, focusing on more technical sets of skills. Grading and ranking should be done based on not only formal tests but also extracurricular and volunteer activities. Moreover, more opportunities for interaction among workers should be promoted with appropriate workplace design and task assignment. Instead of separate offices and individual targets, it is advisable that companies should have opened offices where employees have chances to regularly interact with others.
In conclusion, while there are detrimental effects that could be produced by the lack of interpersonal skills, some measures could be adopted to tackle them. It is recommended that students should well prepare for their cooperation skills to be better careers.",0,"Lack of basic interpersonal skills in new employees is considered to be a major topic of concern in today's world.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There have been debates about whether dangerous sports should be prohibited due to their risk of involvement. While I understand why some people support the former view that negative effects may be present in extreme sports, I still believe that individuals should be free to participate in any sports or activities they want.
Advocates of banning hazardous sports may argue that the danger of these sports poses a threat to people's lives. The reason for this is that even if people have prepared for playing sports thoughtfully, unpredictable accidents might still happen. This may be caused by extreme weather or equipment failures, rendering players more vulnerable than in other sports. For instance, motorbike riders who regularly compete in high-speed races seem to be more prone to injuries than in other sports. In addition, risky sports may encourage violent behaviors, thereby causing fatal consequences in society. Therefore, people think that governments should prohibit risky sports for the aforementioned reasons.
Nevertheless, I believe that people should have the autonomy to play any sports or activities they want. This is due to the fact that extreme sports maintain good physical health and mental health for individuals. People tend to discover the extreme feelings and extreme sports could relieve their stress. Governments, on the other hand, should make legal rules for dangerous sports and encourage some organizations to carefully train players. For example, individuals who have cardiovascular problems are not allowed to participate in Bungee Jumping or Scuba Diving.

Also, urban population density is too high that cities is always over crowded and cause lots of polutions like air polution, water polution or noise polution.
There are solutions to all these problems. The air pollution can be controlled by moving all the industries outside the cities and by finding proper ways to dispose industrial waste. Housing problems can be solved by making new housing societies having good living standards.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars.

Considering various cases, the shortcomings that this trend brings about are far more serious than its benefits.
On the one hand, some positive aspects of the trend towards shopping in large stores located far away may be the convenience for customers and huge profit for the automotive industry. To begin with, large out-of-town stores will probably provide customers with a wide array of commodities, which allows buyers to buy everything on their shopping lists in one time. Additionally, these shops usually have big parking spaces as well as other facilities so that people can have a better shopping experience. Furthermore, the higher demand for cars can prosper the automotive industry, which is considered to be a key sector of the economy for almost every major country in the world.
On the other hand, there are more considerable disadvantages of the habit of driving to big shops on the outskirts. Firstly, the popularity of large suburban stores may drive the small ones to the brink of mass closure. As a result, many people will lose their jobs, and the matter of unemployment will become much more serious. The consequences of this problem are more severe when it occurs in the town center, which should have been the economic center of that city. In addition, out-of-town shops are only available and convenient for people who have cars, which means ones who do not own cars have restricted access to them. The other disadvantage is that the rise in the use of cars will worsen the problem of traffic jams, which has always been a matter of concern in urban areas.

While I accept with the idea of restricting people from trying risky sports, I tend towards the viewpoint the people can freely play any kind of sports that they like.
On the one hand, there are various reasons why hazardous sports should be prohibited by the authorities. Because of the inadequacy of basic knowledge, people may get injured or put their lives at risk when playing these activities. Furthermore, the lack of skills and experiences can leads to death of person. By having a strict policy on dangerous sports, the ability of unpredictable incidents can be reduced.
On the one hand, there are more compelling reasons why people can freely take part in any kind of sports. First, dangerous sports may have positive effects on your mental and physical health. By playing these sports, people are having a sense of excitement and stimulation to deal with the next challenges in their life. Second, safety measures should be considered to impose so that the threats from risky sports can be minimized. For example, many sports which carry element of danger such as skiing or scuba diving should be supervised by experienced and professional coaches.

5665,4,Some people think that increasing communication usage of computers and mobile phones by young people has had a negative effect on their reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is believed that there is an accelerating trend in using computers and mobile phones to communicate among young people. I completely agree with the idea that this trend exerts a range of serious impacts on people's overall reading and writing levels.
The primary reason for my opinion is that almost all the languages used via digital devices are informal. The young's messages exchanged through the internet are often short and include spoken languages, young people even use abbreviated forms of words to save time on typing. However, reading and writing skills are related to formal languages or even academic words. Therefore, when people need to write an article or essay, they tend to use more ambiguous words so they cannot enhance high-quality in sharing their knowledge.
Another reason for the worsening of reading and writing abilities is that the young are over-dependent on technological assistance. almost all modern devices have automatic correction tools for words and grammar, and even, can recommend better words for people's essays. therefore, people do not need to spend time rereading and researching suitable words or grammar. When this reality happens for a long time, young people get used to the help of technology, and their abilities in reading and writing will worsen quickly.
In conclusion, the raising trend toward communicating through computers or mobile phones has adverse impacts on young people's reading and writing skills.

To begin with one of the main problem is traffic jams.

In the large cities, there are many cars public transports which lead to bar the way in the working hour. One of the most effective ways to reduce traffic jams is to rise our awareness.

1345,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"Nowadays, many young people tend to pay much attention to foreign singers and actors or actresses from famous movies, but they do not know much about historical figures of their nations. There are several reasons for this problem, and some actions can be done to encourage young people to find out more about the people from the past of the country.
There are compelling reasons why the young are more knowledgeable about entertainment celebrities than historical heroes. The primary reason is that the entertainment industries are globally dominant, which makes people from all over the world become loyal audiences. For example, if people talk about Korea, the first thing they would know is the Kpop idols, such as Bts, Blackpink, Wanna One, etc. Because of that, the more famous the celebrities are, the more attention they have. Another convincing reason is that many schools teach history by showing too many events and figures. As a result, students would find it boring to learn the country's history.
However, the interest and the understanding of young people about national heroes can be improved by some following actions. One of the most viable solutions is that teachers can use visualization tools to create history lessons. Thanks to the development of technology, there are many various types of equipment for education, including projectors, hi-tech computers, etc. As a consequence, teachers can show videos of documentaries or clips, so that students can be proud of their fascinating history. Moreover, schools can organize extra-curricular activities, or let students do some projects, in order that students can learn history in their own way without feeling dull. For example, Foreign Language Specialized School, which is one of the most prestigious schools in Hanoi, prepared a trip for students to Tuyen Quang province to help them find out more about historical events and places, and then students had to report the trip in any kind of presentation they want. Not only were the students excited because of the sudden holiday, but they were also in a good mood to learn history.
In conclusion, the over-success of the stars and the wrong teaching method can lead to the lack of interest in history in the young generation.

While there are some benefits of this trend, i would argue that its drawbacks are more significant.
The first benefit is that the economic may recieve a huge profit from this kind of traveling. This is because wildlife areas are still vacant and mysteric, which might attract many travelers to come.

Moreover, new creatures and natural resources might be discovered, which contribute to the variaty of ecosystem.

While this approach is good in certain ways, I believe there are many more effective ways to teach pupils about the perils of crime.
On the one hand, the possibility of having reformed criminals give a talk is appealing in some respects. The first benefit is students can learn from those who truly understand crime through this way. This is because ex-prisoners have an insight of the dangers of crime to the victims. As a result, they are able to give students some useful methods to beat the criminals in emergency circumstance. Another benefit that can be seen is that this method may also educate students about the risks to the offenders themselves in case they commit a crime. Those who have gone through corporal punishment would likely to remember how grievous they experience in the jails.
On the other hand, I believe that there are better ways to educate students about the consequences of crime. The first measure might be the application of criminology as an obligatory education program at school. Because it has been searched and concluded by experts, this field of expertise is more reliable compared to the varied experiences of each criminal. Another practical method is to film the harsh daily lives of prisoners and show it to school students. That way, students do not have to come to jails to directly see the criminals' lives but still can understand threats that criminals have to deal with through vivid pictures.

The advertisements about books which aim at children are capable of making those hard-working students's search downright more easier. Take the senior pupils in secondaries and high schools for examples. It is a must for them to gain deeper knowledge, so that they are able to take the national exam transition.

There is a large number of students these day searching for documents that are able to benefit their studies, since a few students wish to acquire more knowledge than just what they were taught at schools. The advertisements about books which aim at children are capable of making those hard-working students's search downright more easier. Take the senior pupils in secondaries and high schools for examples. It is a must for them to gain deeper knowledge, so that they are able to take the national exam transition. This is the precursor of these children's demand for advertisements. To sum up, the kids-aimed advertisements ought not to be banned by the government due to financial problems and pupils' wish for them.",1903,347,15,4.582132564841499,81,83,38,54,8

2253,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"Some employers realize that their newly-hired employees are inadequately equipped with fundamental interpersonal skills such as teamwork skill. This can be ascribed to several reasons and be addressed by possible solutions.
To begin with, the primary reason for the shortage of communication skills is due to the excessive attention to theoretical subjects of the educational system instead of teaching and practicing soft skills in a study environment. That means students solely concentrate on a main studious mission to accomplish a perfect degree as they are educated about in-depth knowledge and professional lectures with an enormous amount of lessons, which exert a negative effect on flexibility and creativity. As a result, a copious number of students are incapable of co-operating and handling group work in an effective manner in spite of having extensive expertise. Another reason is the design of up-to-date workplaces which divides a legion of staff into separate areas corresponding with distinctive tasks. Consequently, there are not many conversations between colleagues which causes the shortage of interpersonal skills.
There are some remedies that can be implemented to address the problem. The primary solution is that universities or schools should adjust the obligatory curriculum properly in order that they can assure the balance between theoretical subjects and social skills practise. To illustrate, organizing extra-curriculum activities related to soft skills such as a speech contest or team-building games. After trying to collaborate time after time, the participants could perform and train basic skills then ameliorate their own strengths in the realm of both basic and aptitude. In addition, companies need to create more opportunities to promote colleague interaction. Instead of working individually, there should be a periodic worker exchange of each assigned area. To be specific, a number of staff will temporarily move to another environment and work for a period of time. This may bring benefits to the communication skills of employees in general by being given chances to interact more with one another.
In conclusion, the lack of basic interpersonal skills in the working environment is attributed to the insufficiency of practicing from educational levels and the scarcity of communication between co-workers. Possible measures including holding more job-related activities at school and promoting colleague interaction by exchanging staff could be adopted to tackle the issues.",0,"Some employers realize that their newly-hired employees are inadequately equipped with fundamental interpersonal skills such as teamwork skill.

In addition, I do believe that going out of the country helps humans to broaden their horizons.

First of all, students find it convenient and interesting using technical devices in communication so they may become much lazier to read and write. These devices provide them various programs to do writing and reading easily. For example, young people do not need to write too much thanks to Microsoft Word or sometimes they can copy the contents on huge number of online pages. This definitely limits their abilities to think.
Another reason is that teenagers spend almost time to surf the internet in computers or private phones to interact with other instead of reading valuable books and writing piece of papers.

Moreover, the young tend to update the latest information on the internet instead of reading books. Eventually, this leads to the degradation of both the writing and reading skills.

Firstly, overpopulation may pose some major problems to city dwellers. The too-high population density in the city will probably lead to the lack of accommodations.

Because of the bad effect that people have to suffer when living in the city, a number of actions should be taken to tackle it. For the problem of overpopulation, I think the government should set up a law that prohibits parents from having more than 2 children and be strict with anyone who does not obey. Another solution is to urbanize the rural area so that people can stay in their hometown without concern about having working and studying opportunities.

6016,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Ex-prisoners being a normal part of the society again after spending time in cells is a hot debate in today's world. Even though former criminals are thought to be dangerous, there are a few reasons why having these people give a talk to children is the best way to warn them about the risks of committing an offence.
On one hand, there are a few reasons why providing ex-offenders an opportunity to communicate to younger generations is not the best solution. A major reason for this is that watching movies about crime and punishment showing the quality of food that criminals are distributed will allow teenagers to experience the dangers of committing a felony. As a result, the young is likely to learn more about offender life. Additionally, many employers are likely to afraid of hiring people who used to be felons, and this makes them difficult to find a stable job. Therefore, they tend to be wrongdoers again. Hence, if young people have a chance to encounter life in cells from films and the media, they will not engage in illegal acts.
On the other hand, there are more reasonable grounds that the young should accept advices from ex-offenders to avoid threats of transgressing the rules. This is because due to spending more time in prisons, ex-offenders who have real life experiences can share difficulties they had to face. For instance, young adults can know more about hard jailhouse conditions and how lawbreakers are treated. As a consequence, teenagers will be aware of the risks of living in sin. Moreover, lawmakers can issue more sever punishments to decrease the juvenile delinquency rate. To be specific, people who commit shoplifting or pickpocketing must be sent to reform schools or even spend at least one year being imprisoned. Thus, this makes youngsters feel fear and do not break the law.
To sum up, while it is necessary for adolescents to from hands-on experience lawbreakers, plenty of more effective solutions should be applied.",0,"Ex-prisoners being a normal part of the society again after spending time in cells is a hot debate in today's world. Even though former criminals are thought to be dangerous, there are a few reasons why having these people give a talk to children is the best way to warn them about the risks of committing an offence. On one hand, there are a few reasons why providing ex-offenders an opportunity to communicate to younger generations is not the best solution. A major reason for this is that watching movies about crime and punishment showing the quality of food that criminals are distributed will allow teenagers to experience the dangers of committing a felony. As a result, the young is likely to learn more about offender life. Additionally, many employers are likely to afraid of hiring people who used to be felons, and this makes them difficult to find a stable job. Therefore, they tend to be wrongdoers again. Hence, if young people have a chance to encounter life in cells from films and the media, they will not engage in illegal acts. On the other hand, there are more reasonable grounds that the young should accept advices from ex-offenders to avoid threats of transgressing the rules. This is because due to spending more time in prisons, ex-offenders who have real life experiences can share difficulties they had to face. For instance, young adults can know more about hard jailhouse conditions and how lawbreakers are treated. As a consequence, teenagers will be aware of the risks of living in sin. Moreover, lawmakers can issue more sever punishments to decrease the juvenile delinquency rate. To be specific, people who commit shoplifting or pickpocketing must be sent to reform schools or even spend at least one year being imprisoned. Thus, this makes youngsters feel fear and do not break the law.

3267,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"It is true that in recent decades, there has been a downward trend for people to use bicycles to commute. There could be several reasons why this is the case, and I believe that the governments should impose a tax on cars and motorbikes and use this money to construct more bicycle lanes to tackle this problem.
There are various reasons why people tend to choose motor vehicles as a form of transport instead of bicycles. The most important reason is the overdependence on modern modes of transport such as cars and motorbikes, which are faster and more comfortable for long journeys than bicycles. Another reason is that there are fewer lanes for bicycles. This means that cyclists would have to ride in the same lanes as motor vehicles, which is dangerous.
There are several actions that we could take to motivate people to use bicycles as a means of transport. The government should introduce a tax on cars and motorbikes. This would make people hesitate to choose motor vehicles and encourage them to switch to bicycles. The government should expend this tax money on constructing cycling paths for citizens. If a cycling path system is developed well, they will use bicycles more and then consider these vehicles as a safe and convenient mode of transport.
In conclusion, the less usage of bicycles is ascribed to the overdependence on cars and motorbikes.

705,21,Some people think that advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, more and more advertisements targeting children, and many people believe that they should be banned. There are convincing reasons why this recommendation is a good idea.
The primary reason why a ban is necessary is that the marketing of unhealthy products, including unhealthy food, high sugar drinks as well as alcohol and tobacco, is linked to various negative outcomes for children. Research indicated that food marketing increases children's immediate and future consumption, and childhood obesity is related to viewing commercial television. Alcohol and tobacco advertising also increase the likelihood that the youth will start to use stimulants early.
Another reason is that advertising may distracts children from their daily activities. For example, watching catchy advertisement with cute cartoon characters on Youtube during mealtime can distract children from eating, thereby reducing their appetite and enjoyment of food. There are even children who are addicted to watching advertisements because of their attractiveness visual and they see advertising as a daily habit or hobby. Moreover, watching too many advertisements containing fictional characters can lead to children becoming paranoid, having thoughts and actions that do not correspond to real life. Children tend to imitate the actions of the characters and that can be harmful.
In conclusion, children are very susceptible to misleading information from advertisements aimed at them.

553,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In this day and age, there is a growing trend of not utilizing bicycles to commute in daily life. This situation springs from certain aspects and should be addressed by some definite measures which will be discussed below.
Firstly, air pollution acts as a latent catalyst to the problem. While the air quality is way substandard in urban areas, the dwellers would tend to avoid spending too much time on roads or turn to using cars or buses to secure themselves from exposure to pollution. For example, the air pollution index in rush hours in megacities such as Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City is registered relatively high, entailing a high risk of breathing problems to bicycle users such as asthma or coughing. Also, farther traveling routes also hinder people from using bicycles frequently. In this fast pace of life, people often turn to more efficient measures to maximize their life, resulting in a stronger preference for engined means of transport to bicycles.
A number of actions can be employed to encourage more bicycle use. One primary solution is to make the biking experience less tiring by providing a separate lane for bikers on the road. By that means, people who care about health and the environment would feel safer and more comfortable rather than being clogged with other fueled vehicles which produce harmful exhausts. Another solution is to equip the bikes with non-emission power such as solar energy or electricity. This helps bicycle users travel more efficiently without causing pollution to the environment.
In summary, there remain some certain reasons why people do not use bicycles as their main means of transport, so feasible solutions should be adopted to tackle this problem.

There are some evident reasons why people hesitate to choose bicycles as a form of transport. The foremost compelling reason is the overreliance on modern transport. These modern transport such as cars, motorbikes and planes are obliviously faster, more convenient and suitable for long journeys. In the past, when bikes were the most common transportation, people couldn't travel long distance and if they need to travel far, they would have to travel as early as they can to reach the place in time, whilst nowadays, modern transportations are common and travelling becomes easier for people. Another convincing reason is that in many countries, including Vietnam, there is no separate path for bikes. It means that cyclists have to ride the same way with another vehicles and it can pose threats to their life.
Given aforementioned alarming issues, some solutions should be employed to rectify them. One of effective solutions is back to imposing higher taxes on gasoline using vehicles. Another measures is that separate paths must be built for cyclists to secure the safe of bicycle users.
In conclusion, the less use of bicycles has exerted a number of adverse impacts on individuals and society as the scarcity of human resources as people use more gasoline vehicles and the increase in vehicles tax. Strong remedies including imposing taxes and building cycling paths should be adopted to mitigate this situation. It is predicted that unless these remedies be adopted, the problems associated with bicycles usage will continue to persist in the future.",0,"Bicycles were the main transport in many decades in the past.

1935,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"These days, the young generation seems to be more informed about global music and movie stars than historical figures in their countries, which may derive from the tedious teaching method and the bombardment of celebrity news. To address this situation, there should be innovations in the way that youngsters are exposed to history.
There are several primary reasons why young people have a far wider knowledge of international artists than people playing significant roles in their domestic history. A common reason is that traditional history lessons, in which teachers ramble in about stories in the past and students must read many chapters of a thick book, could not trigger pupils' curiosity and interest to learn history enthusiastically, and even cause their fear of history classes. Consequently, students tend to mindlessly memorize a long list of names, places, and dates in textbooks only to pass an exam. In comparison, it could be noticed that artists with their mesmerizing performances, blockbusters or even dramas about their private lives are ubiquitous on social media, grabbing teenagers' attention and tempting them into spending long hours finding such topics, hence the better insight into celebrities.
To pique youngsters' interest in learning about significant people in domestic history, some promising measures need to be implemented. Regarding school lessons, instead of learning history through hardbound textbooks, students should be encouraged to engage in extra-curricular activities such as visiting historical museums and memorial sites, or roleplaying sessions of historical heroes, allowing them to feel more engaged and more inclined to keep learning history. Additionally, short movies, documentaries, and motion images portraying past events should be incorporated into the curriculum to make history lessons more appealing and alive, dispelling pupils' boredom during class time. Furthermore, the production of movies about historical figures with vivid sound and visual effects, and extensive advertising campaigns should be placed more emphasis on. As a result, teens are more likely attracted and eager to watch those movies, thus naturally shoving information about historical figures into their minds.
In conclusion, boring history lessons at school and the massive coverage of international celebrities could be the main culprits of young people's lack of knowledge of national heroes in the past, which could be remedied by supplementing extra-curricular activities and stunning illustrations into the curriculum, and investing in producing high-quality historical movies.",0,"These days, the young generation seems to be more informed about global music and movie stars than historical figures in their countries, which may derive from the tedious teaching method and the bombardment of celebrity news.

689,21,Some people think that advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the contemporary world where advertising is probably the most prevalent type of marketing, advertisements are strategised to target for coverage of audience of all ages, children inclusively. This has raised a notion among some people that the act of aiming advertising campaigns towards audience of early ages should be prohibited. Notwithstanding, I strongly believe that the advantages of this phenomenon can outweigh its drawbacks, as it boosts businesses' performance in terms of sales and grants children a chance to develop their sense of preference and decisiveness.
Frankly speaking, the act of promoting child-centric products and targeting children of small age closely correlate to each other, which is ultimately beneficial for businesses from the financial perspective. When choosing a product for their children, parents have a tendency to overlook their own children's preferences and demands in a product and focus on more self-oriented facets themselves. Whilst child-centred products are developed to resonate to the needs of small kids only, adults often fail to recognise the practicality and child-friendliness they will bring in their kids' opinion. Under such circumstances, marketing strategies designated to directly reach the product's primary users-the children-are proved to achieve much more efficiency in terms of audience engagement, product distribution and sales.
Moreover, by aiming advertisements directly at children-their main consumers, child-centred businesses are assisting kids in their venture of establishing their own sense of personal opinions and appropriate decision making. From a very early age, children have been constantly nourishing their multifaceted outlook on everything around them, forming their own viewpoints and learning life lessons by making choices by themselves. The act of directing the promotion of products that kids consume towards any audience other than the children themselves is, henceforth, depriving children of their right to construct their schools of thought on something as fundamental as their own needs and preference. Such acts are likely to impose adverse effects on their decision making ability when they grow to be adults in the future.
All in all, the suppression of distributing child-oriented advertisements is absolutely absurd in regard to the advantages it brings to businesses' monetary supplement and children's self-development. To hinder potential downsides of this phenomenon, instead of complete prohibition of child-centric marketing, there should be more elaborate guidelines and regulations adopted to spare only healthy and favourable advertisements on the market.",0,"In the contemporary world where advertising is probably the most prevalent type of marketing, advertisements are strategised to target for coverage of audience of all ages, children inclusively.

On the one hand, having a journey to South Pole or another places which no one have been appoached before is advantageous in a few aspects.

Despite some obvious disadvantages of this trend, it can be beneficial in some aspects.
There are some disadvantages of retaining data on the Internet. This is firstly because online databases are prone to be stolen and manipulated by hackers. For example, in April 2019, phone numbers, account names, and Facebook Ids of more than 530 million Facebook users had been exposed to the public Internet. The second reason is that accessing online information will require a stable Internet connection, which may be not available in all parts of the world. As a result, those living in remote or mountainous places, where the Internet infrastructure is frequently inadequate, may have difficulty learning from online sources.

There might be some reasons why sharing of prisoner has a positive impact on student thinking.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent years, citizens that are using bicycles to go around the city are getting fewer. In this essay, a few reasons why people tend to use other sorts of transportation and the solutions to tackle it will be discussed thoroughly.
On the one hand, this trend is caused by several reasons. The first reason that can be put forward is that bicycles are dangerous. For example, some countries, do not have bicycles lane so people will go to the road and it is very dangerous because cars and motorbikes are going so much faster. Therefore, some citizens are scared to drive a bicycle on the road, especially children. The second reason is that bicycles are slow and people might be late for work.

So people might prefer using bicycles more often and might get healthy. Consequently, because of this action citizens may have better physical health so they can contribute more to society, and this will lay a foundation for the country's economic development.

However, the drawbacks involved in exploring those types of places are also remarkably high.

There have been many incidents that scientist lost their lives due to unexpected threats when exploring a new environment. Furthermore, the act of discovering the natural environment may come with tourism development, therefore destroying the natural beauty of itself.

For example, when coming to the Kerguelen Islands, the scientist has discovered more than eight species of penguins existed on the same island. However, the drawbacks involved in exploring those types of places are also remarkably high. As a location in which many myths and secrets to be solved, it also comes with unknown dangers and many death risks. There have been many incidents that scientist lost their lives due to unexpected threats when exploring a new environment. Furthermore, the act of discovering the natural environment may come with tourism development, therefore destroying the natural beauty of itself. A perfect example will be the Fansipan Mountain itself, after installing the cable system for direct travel, tourism has seriously damaged the ecosystem and unique species of the Mountain. In conclusion, I believe the disadvantages of people being able to travel to remotes areas outweigh the advantages.",1864,323,14,4.879256965944273,82,74,44,50,15
2804,21,Some people think that advertising aimed at children should be banned. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the development of digital marketing has led to a constant bombardment of advertising targeting different ages, especially kids. It can be argued that this kind of advertisement should be prohibited due to its adverse influences on youngsters.
The key rationale is that children marketing confuses offspring's perception of their self-concept. To specify, in an attempt to increase the marchandise' value, commercials scripts directed at children normally boost the main characters with fabulous images after using the products. This, as a consequence, might mislead young individuals and make them define themselves by what they have instead of who they are. For instance, in the 20s in Vietnam, kids with My Kingdom toys, which were prevalent on Tv, believed they were more powerful and on the next level. By contrast, those who do not own such trendy items are likely to be embarrassed and discriminated against by other kids.
Another significant reason is that advertising aimed at children can put their health at risk. Marketing strategies frequently hide the dark side of the product by distorting and exaggerating its impact with fabulous images or endorse animation characters. For example, Pepsi commercials attribute youngster health-related issues to lack of exercising and praise their drinks for boosting energy to have thrilling active days. Meanwhile, those products in fact are not as effective as they seem but more harmful to kids by causing health problems like obesity. Nevertheless, children are too naive to distinguish truth and easily fall victim to this fallacy.
In summary, there should be a prohibition on advertising directed offspring for its negative effect on awareness and health of kids. It is recommended that children should stay away from these advertisements.",0,"Nowadays, the development of digital marketing has led to a constant bombardment of advertising targeting different ages, especially kids.

This experience gives them valuable and unforgettable memories. When visiting remote areas, people, especially scientists, can widen their knowledge about the natural habitat, and then they will research and proclaim this discovery to all citizens in the world.
Besides these advantages, there are also disadvantages which are far outweighing the benefits. Firstly, when you decide to travel to such an isolated area without careful preparation, the exploration can be risky. For example, the temperature at the South Pole is usually very low, approximately -25 Celsius, which immediately affects people's health. Secondly, the costs of venturing into these places tend to be high that only scientists and rich people can afford this activity. Last but not least, when people find it is easy to come to these places, they will invite their friends or families to come with them and then the environment in a remote area is affected badly by their unconsciousness.

Discuss both views give opinions,"The optimum time for children to begin their formal education is a major topic of concern in today's world. While some people believe that their studies should begin as soon as they can, there are more persuasive reason why the children should start their learning careers at the age of 7.
On one hand, there are some reasons to believe that the earlier children start their learning paths, the better it is for them in the future. The primary reason is some that people believe the earlier children learn, the more intelligent they are. These children will have a head-start over those starting later, and they can get straight A's at school. Another significant reason is that in this modern world, many parents are too busy to take care of their children, they are often left home alone. Parents are afraid that this would hamper children's social skills so many of them decide to send their sons or daughters to schools, where they have to communicate with people from different background. Hence, the students must learn to compromise with others, to listen to their teachers and it would also improve their team-work skills.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that children should not be sent to school at a very early age. This is mainly because A clear example of this is in Finland, which is renowned for its education and top-performing students, children do not go to schools until the age of 7. Moreover, children can develop their true selves when spending time with friends and family. Characteristics like kindness, self-confident, humorous cannot develop by taking academic lessons. Rather than forcing the minors to take academic classes, parents should help their children to develop both their minds and personalities through music, puzzle games or just some family activities like going out for picnic.

While the convenience and efficiency are undeniable, it can be argued that these digital communication methods would cause undesired consequences to the ability of young people in reading and writing.
The most significant explanation for its negative influence is the decreasing capability of using formal languages among youngsters. Via modern applications such as Instagram, messengers, skype and so on, young people tend to text short messages using slangs, abbreviation words, or sometimes just send available stickers in order to quickly and effectively express their ideas. Besides, there have been functions helping correcting grammatical mistakes automatically and suggesting word choice. Therefore, without practices on a regular basis, it would take times to comprehend formal materials with sophisticated vocabulary while reading, not to mention applying it smoothly in appropriate contexts in writing.
Another important reason is the excessive time used for online activities instead of for developing reading and writing skills.

Writing skill would be indirectly affected because reading is considered to be a good way to enrich vocabularies, and increase knowledge, which is beneficial for writing skill.

4998,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is often believed that some people who are released from prison can become law-abiding residents of society. While allowing ex-criminals to speak to students about their experiences is somewhat effective to avoid juvenile crimes, I would argue that such a proposal is certainly not the best and that there are better methods.
A speech made by ex-prisoners may help children aware of the consequences of taking part in unlawful activities. A primary reason is that young people seem to enjoy hearing stories that are shared based on experiences. Their life stories are often vivid and persuasive. Therefore, this can attract the attention of students easily. Another significant reason is that prisoners would feel better by sharing their stories and this is a good way to avoid reoffending for these people. They can connect to society and would be glad for doing something well.
However, I would maintain that there are more effective ways to widen the perspective of students about crime. Firstly, parents play an important role in raising awareness of children about crime at an early age. Research suggested that family has a profound effect on kids and that if their parents are good citizens, they will be properly raised to stay away from crime. In addition to this, people with authority or the right perspective such as police and teachers can influence young people's thinking. Authorities and schools should cooperate to provide crime prevention programmes and moral lessons for students to avoid social evils.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In many cities these days, hardly do we see people use bicycles as a means of transport. There are several reasons that lead to this problem including the conveniences of private cars as well as public transport and the safety of people who use bicycles as a form of transport. It must be addressed by a number of actions, which include the high taxes on other forms of transport and the construction of more cycling lanes.
On the one hand, there are many aspects which cause less use of bicycles. First of all, people rely much on their cars and public transports. This results from the expediency which these means of transport bring to the citizens that allows people to travel faster and have more space to keep their own things. Secondly, in almost all countries, there are many vehicles that travel on the road such as cars, motorbikes, buses and so on. As a result, these means of transport are conducive to serious problems for cyclists. In Vietnam, for instance, this country doesn't have cycling lanes and people who travel by bicycle must have had accidents.
On the other hand, to tackle this problem, there are several things that the government should do to encourage the citizens to travel more by car. Firstly, the authorities can impose high taxes on private vehicles and raise the price of public transport so that people who have many things to worry about in their lives feel that they cannot waste money on these things and might think about changing the way they travel. A second measure is that the government can cooperate with construction and freight companies to invest more money on building more cycling lanes with high quality on many streets to assure the safety of cyclists.
In conclusion, that bicycles are used less to travel can result from many reasons such as these inconveniences and the shortage of cycling lanes in some countries.

Such injuries may leave participants with severe illness at old age, reducing the quality of life. For instance, having a broken bone might lead to numerous disadvantages in daily life activities. In addition, the local councils should consider banning this kind of sport to minimize the level of risk.
However, there are more reasonable grounds that humans can freely attend intense sports and activities. This is firstly because, in modern days, it is possible to participate in risky sports by undergoing appropriate training and equipped with specialized gear. This will be a chance for individuals to step out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves. For example, several people prefer adventurous activities due to their interests.

There are several significant causes why people prefer driving motorbikes or cars to bicycles. A reason for this is that riding bicycles require a large of time-consuming and strenuous in particular long-distance travel due to a slow speed. For example, if citizens choose bicycles as the means of transport, they must wake up earlier than other people driving motorbike or car to work and study which enable them to go to the workplace and school on time. Moreover, this mode of transport is not suitable in some areas that do not have dedicated cycle paths. In Ha Noi, for instance, local bicycle riders always use the same lane as motorized vehicles, easily getting accidents obstruct traffic which driver motorbike could reduce their speed equal to bicycle riders to capture their signal.
A number of solutions could be adopted to incentivize people to use bicycles more. First, the imposition heavy fuel tax promotes the shift from using modern commute and put bicycles as an optimal option. With long-distance travel, for example, users could combine public transport with bicycles which decline time-consuming to the office and school. In addition, if the authorities or private companies envelop the public bicycle hiring service, citizens could raise awareness of using bicycles for short distance travel which makes them enjoy the beauty of the screen and the slow pace of life in cities.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In today's world the usage of bicycles as a type of transport are minimizing. There are some reasons why this is happening and a few solutions for this trend
The primary reason is that the speed of bicycles is much more lower than other kind of vehicle. With the innovative machine, a modern device of transportation such as car, motorbike can reach up to 50 kilometers per hour while the bike is just five to ten kilometers per hour. As a result, the individuals can arrive at their destination faster, so they may choose a car or motorbike in lieu of a bike. Another reason is that people might not want to ride a bike which is a intensive activity and consumes a lot of physical strength, so they possibly choose another sorts of transport which is more convenient and comfortable
This phenomenom exerts several effects and must be addressed by some measure. The major method is raising community awareness of the benefit of riding bicycles. With the spectacular advantage of not emissing any gas and being thin, the bikes should be used more frequently by the citizens who live in a crowded and polluted city. Another solution is reducing the price of each bike, which will help it reach more people such as the young and the children.

These problems cause many threat to society and must be solved by several solution.
There are three main problems in big cities. First, in big cities, the traffic is very bad. There are many vehicles in big cities so traffic congestion is a commen occurence. Although there are some public transports like buses or subways, people still prefer to use private vehicles. Because of having many means of transportation, it causes the second problem is air pollution. Emissions from cars and motorbikes reduces air quality. Factories not only cause air pollution but also water pollution. Many factories dump untreated waste into the rivers or lakes. The final main problem is finding a job in large cities is very difficult. Big cities often have many people, so the chance of finding a job is very little.
To solve these problems, a number of actions could be taken. First, to deal with traffic congestion, maybe government should ban car from the city centre or rise vehicle tax, encourage people to use public transport. Second, to reduce environment pollution, government should strictly manage factories and punish heavily for offending factories, and prioritize production of electric vehicles. Fianlly, government should put more money into universities, create new jobs and eancourage people to move out of the capital.

2620,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Cycling has long been considered an aerobic exercise that offers a wealth of benefits with regard to improving physical health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, this form of transport is no longer prevalent for commuters. There are a few reasons that are the main culprits of this trend, and definite actions must be taken to promote the use of bicycles.
Reasons for this situation are discussed in terms of practical issues. People may hold an apathetic attitude toward cycling because many places in the world, including Vietnam, are no dedicated cycling paths for bicycles. This practice means that cyclists in these regions would have to ride in the same land as other vehicles such as motors or cars, which is undeniably dangerous. Furthermore, there may be less security for cyclists when parking because parking attendants tend to pay more attention to taking care of other vehicles rather than bicycles. For these reasons, many people hesitate to choose this vehicle as a means of transport.
To boost the use of bicycles, the government should invest more in constructing cycling paths for residents. If this system was well-developed, people would change their minds and evaluate that cycling had been safer. In addition, parking managers may arrange the parking area for bicycles in the scope of security staffs' observation, which reminds them to protect this kind of transportation from thieves. For instance, many parking lots have moved bicycles near the security kiosk and established anti-thief devices for this area. With these solutions, I am convinced that bikes will appeal to more users and become ubiquitous in the future.
In conclusion, the unpopularity of bicycles could be attributed to the shortage of dedicated cycling paths and the lack of security that occurred at parking lots. To encourage people to cycle more, the government should allocate more money for building dedicated routes for cyclists, as well as parking managers and parking attendants need to heed more to bicycles.",0,"Cycling has long been considered an aerobic exercise that offers a wealth of benefits with regard to improving physical health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

The primary reason is that these reformed people who feel remorse and realize how their wrongdoings affect the community. Therefore, they can tell students how making a crime can pose a serious threat to the society, how students can avoid being enticed to offend. Another reason is that youngsters seem to be keen on listening people's real-life experience. Stories of ex-offenders can be so vivid and real which can impress students and take precautions for them about being involved in a crime.
However, implementing some alternative measures can be more effective for students to know how dangerous of making a crime. A useful method can be employed is that students should be taught at school about the drawbacks of committing a crime. In other words, teachers can have some creative teaching ways, such as creating situations, showing some short videos for their students to realize criminals and the way to avoid being induced to offend. On top of that, some lessons about laws, and which punishments can be taken when breaking laws should be had to teach students at school. Another measure should be adopted is that parents should give their children some advices related to the risks of becoming offenders. Obviously, parents who have much experience can teach their children how to choose friends to play with, and how to avoid strangers' instigations.
In summary, although the downsides to doing a crime can be shared with students by ex-offenders who then become good residents, this idea is not the optimal solution.

From my personal perspective, the disadvantages of this change far surpass the benefits it renders. In order to provide a more elaborate insight, both advantages and shortcomings will be highlighted via this essay.
On the plus side, this transformation offers the shoppers and retailers some certain benefits. More residents choosing out-of-town stores means more opportunities generated for workers and thus minimize the unemployment rate. To some extent, the economy will be improved on a local scale. Moreover, when shifting from city-center shops to suburban ones, people will have a higher chance to purchase a wide array of commodities with better price due to the fact that the rent of premises in the suburbs is significantly affordable than in the downtown.
On the minus side, I do believe that the downsides it renders far outweigh the aforementioned advantages when it comes to comparison.

Furthermore, the use of Doping in sports is considerably high, leaving a bad health effect on the players' bodies. In addition, due to the intense nature of the games, the audience can get rowdy and become violent if the results are not what they expect. Some people also use sporting events as an opportunity to gamble. For example, the Super Bowl is one of the most common events that Americans usually gamble on. Hence, taking away dangerous sports can greatly help get rid of rampage and gambling addiction. While some firmly believe that people should have the freedom to participate in any sporting activity, I argue that putting an end to dangerous sports is beneficial for the health of players, the audience, and the quality of life. The government should carefully look at the number of accidents happening at sports events and draw a conclusion to stop dangerous sports from hurting more people.",2090,384,16,4.5546875,86,94,40,64,14
5598,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In the contemporary society, bikes are becoming less popular than another means of transport. There are a number of reasons behind this tendency and several solutions should be adopted to encourage individuals to use bicycles more.
There are two primary reasons why bicycles are not a popular transport vehicle. One reason is that they are inappropriate for long-distance journey. Travelling by bikes can be time-consuming to reach far-away destinations because they cannot work automatically and need human's strength to work. Furthermore, using bicycles is also unsuitable for some countries' transport infrastructure. For instance, in Vietnam, there are not enough lanes for bikers and sometimes they have to ride in the same lanes with other cars and motorbikes, which can be poses many threats for accidents.
Fortunately, there are several measures can be implemented to enhance this issue. First of all, the government should impose heavy taxes on motor vehicles. This can discourage individuals to keep using cars or motorbike and ride bicycles for instead to ease the burden of paying taxes. A second step would be modifying the transport system and provide bicyle users with more rights. For example, the governements could pay more expenses for expanding lanes on the road and construct more parking places for bikes in the public. This can help people feel secured to ride bicycles on crowded roads, especially in megacities.
In summary, it is clear that there are various reasons for the low number of bikers nowadays, but this tendency can be changed by several actions. It is predicted that there will be more bicyles on the road in the near future if the remedies are adopted effectively.",0,"In the contemporary society, bikes are becoming less popular than another means of transport.

There are fundamental reasons why the knowledge about historical figures of the young is less than the renowned people in the world.

The other convincing reason is that social medias which are used by mostly celebrities have become globally popular in the world.

For example, teachers should use visualization tools to create their historical lessons. The more interesting the lessons are, the more knowledge are achieved by the students.

3551,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Nowadays, in modern society, bicycles have no longer been used as a transport vehicle as much. Even though this is not a major problem, it should be noticed due to the great advantages of cycling.
There are many grounds why bicycles have lost their popularity as a means of transportation in today's world. This mainly results from industrialization and modernization. The growth of the cars industry, for instance, has produced many automobiles that are safer and are much faster for people to use. While these types of conveyances are more complicated and costlier than bicycles, they are much speedier, can reach more distant destinations, and need less physical effort. Overall, humans crave convenience, and as society evolves, the most common things such as moving are gradually being made easier. From walking, we create bicycles which are certainly more convenient, thus, replacing bicycles with cars and motorbikes is also a part of humanity's development.
Despite the comfort of other modes of transport, bicycles should still be used for multiple reasons, and encouraging people to use them is necessary. People should be informed using social media or by advertisements that riding a bike is one of the best workout exercises, not only does it help improve physical health, but it also reduces the chance of having heart disease. Furthermore, traveling by bike may also protect the environment since bicycles do not release Co2 like fuel vehicles. Another method that can be adopted is that the government can make bicycles public transportation by setting up auto-services for renting bikes at a cheap price, just like the bus.
To conclude, cycling has gradually decreased in people's lives due to the craving for ease and humanity's development and automation. This can be solved by informing people about the benefits of bicycles using the internet or advertising and building services for people to use bicycles as a form of public transport.",0,"Nowadays, in modern society, bicycles have no longer been used as a transport vehicle as much.

1281,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"There has been a controversy around the fact that young people tend to have more knowledge about movie stars rather than about famous people from the history of their own country. This could be caused by some different reasons. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons for the same and provide solutions to create interest in the minds of youngsters.
There are many reason for this indifferent attitude. First of all, there is an unsuitable way of approach. Nowaday, movies or pop music are popular among teenagers, historical figures are rarely mentioned except for a few documentaries which are very jejune and dogma. The second reason is the generation gap. The major achievement of the great people has gained in the past. As a result, it is difficult for youngsters to have sympathized and admiration with the historical figures. Last but not least, young people today are really busy with their study. As the result, they don't have enough time to learn about these people. More than that, there is no community or forum for the youngster who is passionate about famous people from the history in their own country.
Nevertheless, there are numerous available solutions to raise the student's interest in this topic. First, we can make historical figure become more familiar and popular among young people through films and media shows. By that, every children can see them on big screen and know more about them. Secondly, the government should set up museums and encourage children to visit them by subsidized their tickets. The Vietnam Museum of Ethnology, which has student discounts, is a good case in point. Finally, the school can incorporate the diversity of teaching techniques. This is shown by matching traditional teaching format with audio-visual aids or organizing educational trips to famous historical places.

Discuss both views give opinions,"Recently I have read a number of articles arguing about the age for children to go to school. Some people think that children should go to school as soon as possible, others say that 7 years old is the most appropriate age. Personally, I have several views on this matter.
To begin with, young children when they start elementary school often have very good memories and are very intelligent. If the teaching methods are effective and interesting for children, they will understand very quickly and for a long time what they are learning. At that time, they did not have too many thoughts in their heads, so memorizing is very simple. Another better thing is that an early education making children enjoy learning also creates a very good habit for children. They will probably see learning as a fun activity and always love to explore and learn new things. If you keep that habit for a long time, the intelligence and thinking ability of the child will be increasingly expanded. When they have knowledge, it is easier to get good grades in school than children who go to school later. Further, in the future, they will have stable jobs with high salaries and great benefits
On the other hand, not all children have easy access to knowledge. If a child cannot fully understand and love the subjects, it will become pressured on the child to do things they don't like. It causes boredom for children when it comes to learning. Gradually, children will be lazy to study and may affect their learning results as well as their thinking. So I think children should experience their lives and develop positive emotions first. They should be taught about life lessons, creativity, and right thinking. When children have enough soft skills, learning will also become much easier. The time for children to practice these skills is usually around 4-5 years old but I recommend that 7 years old is the most appropriate.
In conclusion, knowledge is important, but children need other skills to improve themselves.

1728,0,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Recently, dangerous sports have been a major topic of concern. While some people argue that such kinds of sports should be prohibited, there is compelling evidence that people should be free to choose any sports or activity they like.
There is a common belief that governments' policy of banning extreme sports is necessary. One main reason is that these kinds of sport are hazardous for players. Injury is possible when participating in any sport, yet the heights, distances, and speeds of daring sports drastically increase the severity of injures that might be incurred. Mountain biking, for instance, involves riders practicing on steep, rough hills with jumps. The terrain on which mountain biking is performed is so perilous that it could lead to serious accidents if the riders lose control of the bike. Another significant reason is that extreme physical activities need large investments to maintain. The expenses for extreme sports include premises rent, play-field construction costs, and the price of specialized accessories. Monthly renting of premises is not cheap, yet exclusively designed sports courts and tools are even more costly. The cost of these physical activities, therefore, is much higher compared to the number of professional participants.
However, there are more reasonable grounds that there should be freedom of choosing sports. Firstly, various types of sports encourage individuals to experience more as many people want to perform as different personalities and bestow themselves the chance to get out of their comfort zone. For example, when asked by the American air driving center the reason for their application to join bungee jumping, most participants answered that it is for fun and they feel energized doing such things. Furthermore, it is believed that sports with dangers involved help enhance fearlessness. Like other activities, these kinds of sports are only difficult in a few first attempts, but once properly handled, they are much of thrill and enjoyment. An example of this is my own getting away from the fear of height by trying paragliding.
In summary, although there are reasons for the act of banning daring sports activities, there is more persuasive evidence that individuals should have the freedom to make a decision on what sporting activities they want to do. It is recommended that there should not only be legal rules for extreme sports but also organizations for training and monitoring these types of activities.",0,"Recently, dangerous sports have been a major topic of concern.

Although big cities give them better chances to find jobs with high salary or start up, there are several troubles daily that they have to experience. However, there are many ways to solve these problems.
To begin, traffic problems, especially traffic jams are always a big problems for people who live in big cities.

The next problem is about accommodation. Many migrant workers or just the people who live in rural areas come to big cities to get a well paid job cannot find accommodation. There are many reasons for it. For instance, the price for rent or buy of some accommodations is too high for them to pay and the cheaper one have already owned by someone else, so that was really hard for them to find any suitable accommodations with a cheap price.

One the one hand, there are some reasons to believe this progress is beneficial. The primary reason is that tourists who have chances to travel to remote natural areas could broaden their horizons.

1485,28,"It is impossible to help all people in the world, so governments should only focus on people in their own countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"," The topic related to whether administrations should provide help globally or domestically is hot-debated to the societies. Although it is understandable why supporting all human beings worldwide is unachievable, I partly disagree that governmental subservience should mainly be concentrated on the satisfaction of local demands.
On the one hand, the hesitation of the worldwide authorities in supplying international aids is justifiable and easy-sympathetic. To begin with, governments' support is quite complicated to reach all of the underprivileged since the quantity of those people is immense in multiple countries around the Earth, and their requirements for a living are heterogeneous. Developed nations, for example, may face some obstacles in transporting food and medicine to the regions that are suffering from poverty in unwealthy countries, such as around Africa.

In conclusion, although it is complicated to help all human beings on Earth, especially the Underprivileged, international aids is still pivotal for countries facing the burden of indigence and severe economic shortage. It is a recommendation that people from all over the world should join hands to support unstable nations.",0," The topic related to whether administrations should provide help globally or domestically is hot-debated to the societies. Although it is understandable why supporting all human beings worldwide is unachievable, I partly disagree that governmental subservience should mainly be concentrated on the satisfaction of local demands. On the one hand, the hesitation of the worldwide authorities in supplying international aids is justifiable and easy-sympathetic. To begin with, governments' support is quite complicated to reach all of the underprivileged since the quantity of those people is immense in multiple countries around the Earth, and their requirements for a living are heterogeneous. Developed nations, for example, may face some obstacles in transporting food and medicine to the regions that are suffering from poverty in unwealthy countries, such as around Africa.

However, I believed that the responsibility of educating children about crime should belong with school and family which would produce more desirable result compared to a former talk with ex-prisioners. Initially, parents should educate their children about criminal world, how to avoid them and toward them to good behaviour. A major reason for this is that a significant percentage of crime is on the rise in the teenage years that have problems with the psychological instability due to childhood. In addition, the school system play an important role in raising awareness for students about crime.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Dangerous sports are one of the most attractive activities today. While some people believe that they have the right to indulge in any sport due to their interests, there is more compelling evidence that the government should forbid those unsafe activities.
The belief that people should be free to engage in extreme sports is reasonable for several reasons. The primary reason is that joining this kind of sport may aid people to reduce stress effectively. To explain, when people take part in this activity, their brain produces the necessary hormones to diminish stress such as dopamine, which makes people satisfied and delighted. Therefore, people may be more productive and creative to work and study. Another reason is that companies providing dangerous sports now have many strict rules and standards to guarantee participants' safety. For instance, skydiving, a well-known activity, has age restrictions and requires a professional instructor to jump with each participant. Once individuals' safety is assured, they can freely do risky sports without hesitation.
However, I am firmly convinced that unsafe activities should be restrained by the government. It is mainly because those extreme sports may cause serious injury to an individual's physical health. For instance, breaking a bone makes it become weaker and more vulnerable. In a long term, people cannot do heavy activities that could lower their life quality. Engaging in this kind of activity, additionally, may result in some mental illness. Being over-scared or injured when playing those sports, for example, can lead to anxiety and depressive disorders. As a result, it takes people a long time and a lot of money to recover.

Vietnam, for example, needs to prioritize elementary education to all children especially those in rural areas before transferring voluntary teachers to other countries.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Expeditions to distant isolated destinations have been on the rise recently. While this can potentially benefit wildlife conservation programmes, I firmly contend that the development is disadvantageous overall considering the risks to the environment.
On the one hand, both scientific and touristic expeditions can help develop conservation programmes. Indeed, on-site scientific research conducted at Antarctica has successfully illuminated the mating habits of many nearly-extinct animal species such as the emperor penguins thanks to close observation of these species, driving initiatives to boost their fertility rate two fold. Meanwhile, tourists who visit remote destinations might learn about the damages of climate change, thus becoming intrinsically motivated to protect Earth's fragile ecosystems from further degradation. For example, a campaign to preserve Himalayan bald eagles was initiated by two Swedish explorers on an expedition after they eye-witnessed eagle chicks dying of starvation on a far-flung mountain peak.
On the other hand, I believe the threat of pollution these activities pose must be highlighted. One obvious danger is oil spills from the cruise ships and other forms of transportation traveling to the remote observation sites. In 2007, a cruise boat heading to the South Pole struck an iceberg and sank to the ocean floor, causing a diesel fuel spill that covered 25 square kilometers. Despite enormous efforts from the international community, the disaster claimed the lives of thousands of sea creatures including many rare marine birds in less than two weeks. It also resulted in permanent damage to the Antarctic fauna, algae and plankton, which are the foundation of the local food chain, disturbing the ecological balance across the entire continent and nearby waters.
In summary, although scientific research and intrepid tourism in remote areas might partly contribute to conservation breeding efforts, I am of the opinion that they pose more pressing existential threats to the environment and natural habitats.

What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"An increase in the popularity of the workforce suffering from a shortage of social and communication skills is a topic of concern in the field of business. This trend can be ascribed to some issues related to the educational system, which can be ameliorated by a number of comprehensive remedies that I will analyze in this essay.
A scarcity of interpersonal skills among employees can be attributed to the fact that people don't have the opportunity to practice such skills prior to their careers. In some schools in Vietnam, for instance, students might not regularly express their own ideas, give a speech, work in a team, or even just interact with their mates. This is mainly because the educational programs that they have to undertake are quite heavy and predominantly based on theoretical knowledge, which is quite impractical. Hence students tend to spend more time observing knowledge instead of working in a team, engaging in social activities,... Another reason is that employees rarely have the chance to take part in internships. To explain, being involved in a real work situation can facilitate employees communicating with customers, working with other colleagues.
A number of measures can be adopted to mitigate the aforementioned problem. First and foremost, students should be allowed to engage in social activities along with learning. The Minister of education should consider lightening the educational programs that students have to undertake and give students more space to express their perspectives and contribute to the lessons. Another effective solution is that schools and universities should cooperate with companies to bring internships as a part of educational programs. By doing so, it might ensure that employees can be exposed to work quickly, which could help develop their skills.

On the one hand, I agree that youngers should spend more time on cultural activities for some reasons. Firstly, you should know about the value of cultural activities, there are all activities to pay tribute to ancestor by alot of activities like dance, sing... Thus, I think it also reflect the rich tradition of Vietnamese people, so when they reseach about the cultural music or theater they might be hooked on it and then they'll love and take action to preserve it. Moreover, youngers will promote national pride then they can propagate the culture toward foreigners and the young also can make their cultrue become more expandable and better. For example, if the young present people around the wolrd about "" Cheo "" wich is one of the most famous art form in Vietnam, they will recognise the brillance of it and it will might be spread everywhere.
On the order hand, I firmly believe that spend time on sport is still benefical in some aspects. As a matter of fact spend less time on sport isn't good for their health esecially physiscal health, which will get worse if someone don't do exercises. Spending time on sport can help youngers to practise more in order to stay healthy and chill out after stress times on work or study. Doing sport can help the young to spend less time on social media or surfing the internet, which's harmful for thier eyes.

Moreover, youngers will promote national pride then they can propagate the culture toward foreigners and the young also can make their cultrue become more expandable and better. For example, if the young present people around the wolrd about "" Cheo "" wich is one of the most famous art form in Vietnam, they will recognise the brillance of it and it will might be spread everywhere. On the order hand, I firmly believe that spend time on sport is still benefical in some aspects. As a matter of fact spend less time on sport isn't good for their health esecially physiscal health, which will get worse if someone don't do exercises. Spending time on sport can help youngers to practise more in order to stay healthy and chill out after stress times on work or study. Doing sport can help the young to spend less time on social media or surfing the internet, which's harmful for thier eyes. In addition spend time on sport may help youngers to improve some useful skills, that may be worth in some case like by accident. Inconclusion, spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theater and less time on sport is needed for youngers.",1956,378,14,4.26984126984127,74,91,32,56,21

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","That the scientists and tourists now are able to travel to such remote natural environment as the South Pole is a controversial topic in our modern society. While this trend is beneficial in a few aspects, its shortcomings are more significant.
On the one hand, it goes without saying that travelling to these isolated areas brings several advantages. First and foremost, these places can help scientists with their studies of Mother Nature and also broaden their knowledge of natural habitats as such regions own valuable geological and biological information. Thanks to analysing this data, researchers can comprehend more about biodiversity as well as how much people affect on the nature. For instance, travelling to the South Pole shows that food source of animals such as polar bears or penguins can easily be impinged on by water contamination and global warming which are mainly caused by human. Therefore, scientists can research to find out more ways to conserve this biodiversity. Moreover, discovering natural beauty is such an interesting kind of travelling that it provides people with precious experience and unforgettable memories. Thus, they might be more awareness of environmental protection.
On the other hand, there are more significant disadvantages that far outweigh the positive aspects. It is a fact that when some people are able to access and explore these distant and unpopulated places, others will have a tendency to reside or start their business there too. As a result, this tourism industry together with human's lack of awareness will spoil the natural environment with water and air pollution or deforestation. Beside, people may face a risk to travel to such remote zones unless they prepare properly. Severe weather is the South Pole is harmful to people's health while savage wildlife in the Amazon forest with animals and insects may put travellers' lives in danger.

Of course, having a talk to schools from ex-criminals gives some positive impacts on students. This means that offenders who suffered real experiences could give students vivid pictures in prison through their physical and mental problems they overcame. These stories would send a message to listeners that every mistake must be paid for. This way is considered as a preventive measure motivating the young to foster morally sound values and be good citizens.
However, there are more persuasive ways to warn students who might be involved in juvenile delinquency so that they have all-round awareness about the dangers of committing a crime. Criminal lessons might be added into the educational system as an extracurricular activity where students would discuss about crime or have meetings with criminalists. For example, these lessons could get started by watching a short documentary film or a controversial video about crime, after which students would get involved in some discussions, write an essay related to this film. This could provoke students to think critically and independently, and also help students passively absorb information and knowledge without tediousness.
In general, although the idea that offenders after returning to community could have a talk with students in schools as the way to hinder the young from committing a crime could be recommended, there are a lot more other convincing methods, such as organising criminal classes for students, which should be considered by schools.

1152,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"Coverage of international celebrities attracts greater attention from the young today than documents about historical figures do. This stems from the impacts of mass media and conventional teaching methods. With a view to stimulating youngsters' interest in history, modifications in curriculum and media campaigns are crucial.
Limited historical understanding among young people is associated with certain factors. The primary reason is their frequent exposure to social media and online newspapers which mostly feature influencers in the entertainment industry. This generates the young's growing fascination for updates on famous people, namely their personal life and recent artwork. Furthermore, exam-oriented education acts as a precursor to students' reluctance to research history. The majority of historical lessons are solely based on academic textbooks, therefore minimizing learners' active engagement.
The issue calls for innovative changes in terms of mainstream media and school programs. It is vital to run massive campaigns aimed at young audiences to recreate their enthusiasm for national history. Hoa Lo Prison Relic, for example, has successfully renewed its digital platform and published a podcast series narrating historical figures' stories. In addition, history curriculum should adopt relevant materials and interactive activities including documentaries and museum or monument visits.
All in all, young people become attracted to well-known artists rather than renowned historical characters due to social media influence and traditional schooling methods. In response to this problem, widespread media campaigns and educational innovations are of key importance. It is predicted that an increasing number of youngsters will proactively acquire knowledge about the country's history.",0,"Coverage of international celebrities attracts greater attention from the young today than documents about historical figures do. This stems from the impacts of mass media and conventional teaching methods. With a view to stimulating youngsters' interest in history, modifications in curriculum and media campaigns are crucial. Limited historical understanding among young people is associated with certain factors. The primary reason is their frequent exposure to social media and online newspapers which mostly feature influencers in the entertainment industry. This generates the young's growing fascination for updates on famous people, namely their personal life and recent artwork. Furthermore, exam-oriented education acts as a precursor to students' reluctance to research history. The majority of historical lessons are solely based on academic textbooks, therefore minimizing learners' active engagement. The issue calls for innovative changes in terms of mainstream media and school programs. It is vital to run massive campaigns aimed at young audiences to recreate their enthusiasm for national history. Hoa Lo Prison Relic, for example, has successfully renewed its digital platform and published a podcast series narrating historical figures' stories. In addition, history curriculum should adopt relevant materials and interactive activities including documentaries and museum or monument visits. All in all, young people become attracted to well-known artists rather than renowned historical characters due to social media influence and traditional schooling methods. In response to this problem, widespread media campaigns and educational innovations are of key importance. It is predicted that an increasing number of youngsters will proactively acquire knowledge about the country's history.",1811,282,15,5.531914893617022,86,93,43,31,8
915,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Prisoners who have been released and have become good citizens, giving talks to students, are a major source of concern in schools. While this way will aware students of the dangerousness of committing a crime in a few ways, it is far from being the best remedy to teach them to have a good sense of humanity.
On the one hand, listening to a person who underwent an amount of time in prison is associated with a few benefits. This is primarily because the rehabilitated offenders have real-life experience in prison so that they will have a holistic view about how criminals are being treated and how they suffer from this to share with the students. In addition to this, adolescents can feel more interested in hearing ex-criminals discuss about this topic rather than hearing it from teachers or someone that cannot understand all about prison life. As a result, they can be informed about the negative impact of committing a crime and should be aware of it. Furthermore, ex-offenders would feel better if they shared their life stories, and this is a fantastic method for these people to stay away from reoffending. They can also feel more connected to society and grateful for accomplishing something worthwhile.
On the other hand, there are more persuasive ways to keep children informed about the dangers of crime. The first option is for youngsters to be exposed to the hazards of committing crimes by seeing films about incarceration and punishment or programs that promote crime prevention. For instance, people may notice the harsh conditions or believe that spending time in jail is a waste of time that could be spent on more productive endeavors. As a result, young individuals are more prone to learning about criminal life or finding information about criminology if they want to have more knowledge of this topic. Moreover, governments can impose heavier sentences on juvenile delinquency. People who commit minor crimes, such as shoplifting and pickpocketing, for example, must be sent to a reform school where they will receive education and vocational training.

The reasons for this are varied and several solutions would be proposed to promote the usage of bicycles.
There are several reasons why few people use bicycles to travel on a regular basis. The most prominent reason is that individuals nowadays want to spend as little time on transport as possible since modern life is getting much busier. As a result, they tend to choose other types of vehicles such as motorbikes or cars which would obviously take less time. Another convincing reason is that there are no bicycle lanes in many places in the world. This means that cyclists in these areas must share the road with other cars, which is certainly risky.
A wide range of measures can be implemented to increase the popularity of bicycles. First of all, it would be to make it more costly to own a motorbike or a car. This can be done by imposing a heavy tax on these vehicles. Therefore, more people would choose bicycles as their primary means of transport. Furthermore, more lanes should be built to serve only cyclists by the fund of government. Bicycles can be considered a secure and convenient mode of transportation until the cycling path infrastructure is well-developed.
In conclusion, bicycles are becoming less common in today's world can be attributed to the busyness of life in the world and the lack of dedicated bike routes.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that technology is gaining more and more popularity in some aspects of humans' life.

One explanation is that communication via chatting on online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram makes people fall into bad habits of using slang words and abbreviations at an uncontrolled frequency. Therefore, they may get into trouble with dissertations or colleagues group discussions because these types of writing need the understanding of informal terms' usage, which they cannot learn from chatting online. In addition to this, the more time young people spend communicating through mobile devices, the less patient they are. To explain, online contents used for communication do not require readers' meticulousness because of their briefness, so they may make youngsters unable to concentrate on an essay with a lot of details in a long time. For instance, students who are used to short messages or texts on online applications may be impatient to find and sum up information in thousands of documents to complete their presentations.
However, there is stronger evidence that mobile applications and desktop software can improve youngsters' reading and writing abilities. One important reason is that these devices provide young people with installed programs such as Grammarly, Ms-word and so on, which are used to check for their grammar and vocabulary after finishing their essays or Cvs. As a result, the young can detect their mistakes and correct them in time. For example, when a student prepares his presentation at university, he can take advantage of these websites to ensure his cohesion marks. Another reason is that using these electronic gadgets to communicate allows people to share and absorb tips about how to boost the capability of literacy.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge and experience.","People living in large cities is a major topic of concern in today's world. This situation exerts several impacts on society and must be tackled by some measures.
People living in big cities may confront several problems in life. One problem in cities is traffic congestion. In other words, in big capitals or in the city centre, residents usually get stuck on roads, especially in the rush hour, which makes citizen's life more stressful and unhealthy. This is because of narrow roads and the increase of urban population. Another reason is that people use their own vehicle instead of public transport. , more cars on the road will likely cause traffic congestion. As a result, it will create exhaustion, tension and stress to citizens. Many people will get late for work, which affects their job and their life. To solve this issue, the government needs to widen more roads or prohibit car in city centre to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The government can also make public transport free, which encourages people to go by bus or by train instead of their own vehicle. This can also protect the environment when less exhaust fumes is created.
Another problem is air pollution. The reason comes from traffic jam, which creates exhaust fumes. This is dangerous to the resident's health. To reduce pollution, people should plant more trees and city green places.
This concern poses many threats to society and must be addressed by a number of solutions.

5791,9,Young people should spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theater and less time on sport. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Some people argue that children should spend more time on cultural activities and less time on sport. While there are some benefits to spending more time on cultural activities, I maintain that sports should be as much time as traditional activities.
On the other hand, there are many reason why children should spend time on cultural activities. Firstly, not at all young people are keen on activities such as music, theater. Hence, this will lead to depression and not get good benefits. Secondly, cultural engagement help young people improve their mental health and intellectual development. For example, watching theater may allow young audience to ease their mind and raise their imagination, which is the most level improvement for children. However, children only stay in one place to have to learn play musical instruments or watch theater in these activities, which cannot develop physical aspects.
Nevertheless, I believe that that regular sport participation is more important to the youth than cultural engagement for several reasons. The first reason relates to develop both all aspects: metal, intellectual and physical since it could allow them to stay in shape and have more energy to work or study and also control their weight. Besides, playing sport can help children build more relationship and learn teamwork skills. For example, playing football games with friends together, help them keep good relationships with their classmates.
In conclusion, it seems evidence that both cultural activities and sports have their own advantages, but I maintain that younger people should take part in these activities equally.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","In some countries, many small shops in city centers are engaged face to face with closure because of the mushrooming of large stores in the suburb. While this change is advantageous in a few aspects, the disadvantages are more significant.
There are some benefits of the construction of large businesses that are based on the outskirts. Firstly, it relieves pressure on housing supply systems. For example, when the majority of stores are located in the outskirts of cities, citizens tend to move to suburban areas to live, which leads to the decrease of traffic jams in rush hour. Secondly, the appearance of stores in the outskirts leads to the decrease of unemployment rate in some countries. Also, large out-of-town stores provide more employment opportunities for the locals there. Therefore, lots of countries develop their local economy more dramatically than before.
However, the drawbacks of the construction of out-of-town stores are significant, far outweighing the advantages. Firstly, increasing small town-center shop puts local people to great inconvenience as currently, they have to go a distant place to shop. Instead of wasting time going to the out-of-town stores, citizens tend to spend this time doing greater important activities namely work or recreation. Secondly, it causes a significant loss for the economy of any city where large numbers of such businesses are forced to shut down. Thirdly, environmental pollution is increasing, which is caused by the urbanizations in the outskirts. In addition for that reason, the more stores are built, the more plants were cut down. That leads to a decrease in the quality of resident's lives in the suburbs.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Whether people should go to the remote natural environment is a great deal of public attention in modern society. While this trend is advantageous in a few aspects, the drawbacks are more significant.
On the one hand, there are some positive aspects of setting foot in wild regions that are beneficial. A reason for this is that if people, especially scientists, visit remote areas, they will have more knowledge about the natural habitat. When coming to the North Pole, for example, scientists can get more information about the life cycle of Polar bears which live far away from humans. In addition to this, if it is possible for tourists to safely travel to these places, the revenue generated from tourism activities can help develop the countries where these areas are located.
On the other hand, there are more considerable disadvantages to exploring extremely remote places. This is primary because going with revealing the new scientific secrets, there are also unknown dangers waiting to harm people who want to have trips to remote regions. Moreover, despite the fact that tourism can discover a new environment, but humans should no longer do so. There are natural regions that might be so fragile that any tries to prepare them for tourism can permanently break them. The Son Doong Cave in Vietnam, recognized as the biggest common cave within the world, is one illustration of this. There have been numerous specialists who voiced their concerns that activities for mass tourism, such as introducing a cable car framework through the cave, can genuinely harm the special landform and environment there.

273,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent decades, with the emergence of modern transports, people are riding bikes less than ever before. This phenomenon can be attributed to a number of reasons, and several solutions should be adopted to motivate people to use bikes.
There are two major reasons why people stop utilising bicycles. The main reason is that riding bikes might be much more time consuming and physically demanding than other means of transportation. In comparison with subways, bikes travel at a slower pace and bikers have to constantly focus on maneuvering the vehicles which can be a stressful task. Another reason is that riding bikes can be inconvenient since it is easily affected by natural factors. Cyclists may struggle to ride under harsh weather conditions including storms or snow, while car drivers can drive regardless of such weather.
Fortunately, several acts can be taken to promote the use of bikes. The first solution would be establishing bicycle-dedicated lanes. This measure can improve the safety and let cyclists ride at higher speeds since they do not have to share roads with other commuters. Riding experience, as a result, will be safer and more enjoyable, which will likely promote cycling. Besides, people should be informed about the health benefits of cycling, which may act as an incentive to riding bikes. An office staff, for instance, may make use of commuting by bike to the workplace to burn extra calories and get in shape.
In conclusion, the decline in the number of bicycle users is due to the fact that it is inconvenient, and requires much time and energy.

Considering that the majority of participants in dangerous sports are young adults and grown-ups, who play a crucial role in the working-age population, extreme physical activities may indirectly lead to the deterioration of the national human resources.
On the other hand, those sports actually offer a wide range of benefits to the players, and the choice to indulge in such should be respected rather than be forbidden by law. The aforementioned sports are an opportunity for interested people to ameliorate physical health, and to relieve stress after being stressed by pressure at school or the workplace.

On the whole, while there is a common belief that extreme sports should be banned as a result of the possible detrimental effects, the line of reasoning that individuals have complete control over which physical activities they take part in has proven to be more persuasive.

5257,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"In modern society, there is a common belief that former prisoners, who have been in jail and then become good dwellers later, should discuss with school students to help them understand the costs of violating the laws. From my perspective, although this education method may have some drawbacks, I believe that this is the most suitable and effective way to prevent teenagers from committing crimes.
On the one hand, having former prisoners talk with students to reduce teenage crimes tends to have several disadvantages. Firstly, the prisoners are likely to be unsuitable for teaching students. To explain, former prisoners usually lack teaching skills such as communicating with teenagers or understanding their behavior and thoughts so they tend to use inappropriate words and information. Secondly, hiring them may cause some misunderstandings among the young. For instance, students may think that it is acceptable to violate the rules and commit crimes because they observe the lessons by these prisoners as an example of life after being a criminal without any consequences.
On the other hand, this new teaching method is believed to have many significant benefits. To begin with, lessons from prisoners may be more influential to youngsters. That is because teenagers seem to rebel against their teachers' or parents' lessons, which are often not realistic. However, real experiences and stories from former prisoners tend to affect students' behavior and awareness significantly. Furthermore, this education method is likely to offer prisoners job opportunities. For example, many prisoners may find themselves suitable for teaching or presenting so they can choose to become a presenter or lecturer, which can help them increase life quality and their incomes.
In conclusion, having former prisoners talk with teenagers is an effective teaching method as it often gives them realistic lessons as well as offers more job opportunities. However, there may be some misunderstandings and unsuitable lessons.",0,"In modern society, there is a common belief that former prisoners, who have been in jail and then become good dwellers later, should discuss with school students to help them understand the costs of violating the laws.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the advance in technology, high-tech gadgets such as computers and mobile phones have become popular. Some individuals see this as a detrimental effect on writing and reading proficiency. I completely agree with this notion to some extent as it deteriorates our basic skills
The most important reason is that the over-dependence on technology would negatively affect youngsters' writing and reading abilities. This is because technological assistants are equipped with inbuilt grammar and dictionaries that auto-correct any grammar and spelling mistakes. For instance, some software programs such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs offer convenient functions and intelligent dictionaries to avoid vocabulary mistakes and even suggest the next word which impairs writing skills in the long term. Moreover, due to the development of modern devices, people, particularly adolescents, tend to neglect their studies to spend time playing games and watching videos rather than reading activities. This lack of reading practices might lead to poor reading capacity.
Another reason for the overuse of computers adversely impacts the ability to read and write is the propensity to use informal language for communication. Whereas news and serious reading involve formal language, most of the messages contain acronyms and stickers to express emotion. Young people who send messages via social chatting applications, for example, Whatsapp, Messenger and so on, usually abbreviate their words in order to communicate faster. While this looks harmless but further lands them in trouble while writing essays and doing presentations as it becomes arduous for them not to use informal terms.
In conclusion, there is a proclivity for using spoken language and over-reliance on digital devices when transmitting via the Internet.

On the one hand, I agree that parents' teachings are good for children for some reason. Firstly, mother and father are the best teacher. For example, people who taught a child first steps, babbling first words, provide and send them to school is their mom and dad. Therefore, they always have many experiences in the life compared to the children.. Furthermore, every parent love and wishes the best things for their kids so they never do anything harmful for them. Because of that, I think that the children should obey their parents when they are little.
On the other hand, in my view, the parents should let the child be free with their experience and choice. Everything don't need to be perfect, even when the child do the wrong and fails, they can learn many valuable lessons. More important, parents not always right. Sometimes, because overprotective of the kid, parents control everything and always decide what they think is right, regardless of the the kid's feelings. Another reason is that, the world is always changing a lot, because of that the new generation have to face with variety of new challenges and problems which their parents never know before. So, children have to take their own decision according to the modern lifestyle. Thanks to that, they will become more smart and creative.

Although urban is a very attractive place to live, and it provides a wide range of work and a better living standard than rural, there are also many social problems that people must face in their daily life.
One of the biggest problems people facing in their normal life is high property prices. In many cities, buying a house near the city center is out of reach for people who have an average salary. As a consequence, people who cannot afford to buy a house near the center are forced to live on the outskirt and to commute to work. In London, for instance, the price of a one-bedroom flat is prohibitive for many people. The true problem is the lack of accommodation. To solve this problem, the government could put more resources into building affordable housing, which would allow more people to buy their own homes so the cost of a house will decline.
The cost of public transport is also a serious problem. That is to say, in some big cities, the price of using public transport such as buses or taxis is very high. In Paris, people who do not have their own transportation have to use a large percentage of their income on public transport. The solution is to decrease ticket prices. This would encourage more people to use public transport.

There are several benefits there but people also have to face many challenges in their life; and some measures should be taken to mitigate the consequences of such problems.
To begin with, the main problem for anyone who lives in cities is the cost of living. They have to spend a huge amount of money for accomodate, transport, and even food. For example, the cost of a flat or a house, in central Hanoi, is unaffordable for many people, especially for people on the average salary. Another problem facing city dwellers is traffic jams. The increasing population in large cities leads to more means of transport being used. Take Mumbai for example, citizens here hit the wall for long hours in jams because of the cramped roads. Moreover, pollution is one of the most prominent issues in many big cities nowadays. The high volume of traffic is a significant contributor to the decrease of air quality. Therefore, the number of people suffering respiratory diseases is dramatically increasing, particularly asthma and lung cancers.

However, there are various steps that governments should take to tackle these problems. Firstly, they could invest the money in social housing to reduce the cost of living. Secondly, governments should improve the quality of public transports to encourage people to use it, that would help to reduce both air pollution and traffic jam.

While advertising can have several negative impacts on children, I believe that such a ban is not a good idea and disadvantageous to other people.
The first reason why commercials aimed at children have detrimental effects, particularly on their health is that various fast food and beverage companies direct their marketing strategies towards youngsters, making their products appear to be eye-catching and healthy. Therefore, inexperienced children are easily persuaded to purchase these unhealthy foods impulsively, and as a consequence, can be prone to obesity or at risk of other serious health issues such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Another reason is that commercial advertising has also negative impacts on the relationship between parents and their children. The more children are manipulated to possess products they see in Tv advertisements or leaflets, the more conflicts are created by the young and their parents if parents do not give their children what they want.
However, I think that there should not be banned on advertising targeted at children, which is one of the key aspects of a prosperous economy. A number of companies would suffer from a decrease in sales and profits, as a result, affect unemployment rates and the national economy. Some renowned brands such as Mcdonald's, Coca Cola provides thousands of job opportunities in advertising throughout its branches around the world. As a fact, if bans were imposed on commercials, many workers such as marketers may become unemployed for a while. This means that the government will have to provide temporary financial support for those.
In conclusion, despite the certain negative influences of advertisements aimed at children regarding well-being and family relationships, imposing a prohibition on it is not the most effective solution. It is recommended that both schools and parents need to teach children critical thinking skills in order to enhance their cognitive ability so that they are no longer misled by rampant advertising.",0,"These days, many people argue that advertisements targeted at children should be banned because of their consequences.

2278,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Educating children about crime has always been an important issue. While some people believe that schools inviting people who are out of prison to give a speech to students is an effective measure, there are better ways to warn adolescents about the dangers of committing crimes such as police-speech and subject-learning.
People who were imprisoned can help the society reduce the crime rate. This is primarily because of the mentality of the people. As reformed prisoners have tried life in prison, they can share their experience to the students, so that students can be aware of doing anything wrong. Moreover, reformed prisoners themselves can somehow contribute to society. By talking to the students, they can recall their memories about the bad things that happened, and not commit more wrongdoing. As a result, there would be less crime in the country.
However, imprisonment is not the best solution for lowering the sin rate. One of the solutions is letting the police speak at schools. They can inform school children about several appropriate crimes and punishments that can have a profound impact on children. Another interesting solution is that students can learn many subjects at schools. For instance, in civic education, students can learn punishments for each kind of wrongdoings, so that they can be scared of breaking the law. Or in History, students can realise that the offenders are all punished by the law. As a consequence, children would abide by the law now and in the future.
In conclusion, although prisoners create deterrent effects on potential offenders, this solution is not the most powerful one. It is recommended that schools should continue teaching many subjects, combined with speeches from imprisoners and police, in order that students can be law-abiding adults for the time forth.",0,"Educating children about crime has always been an important issue.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In modern days, individuals tend to communicate with each other through portable communications devices that have discouraged real interaction.

Firstly, emailing and messaging enables people to contact their acquaintances in different cities without spending their time arranging a face-to-face meeting.

Therefore, family gatherings not only take a considerable amount of time but are also impossible to organize. However, thanks to the support of modern technology, these adverse are able to deal with without any difficulties. Civilians still could keep in touch with their relatives and close friends.
Secondly, social networking has removed boundaries in getting on well with new friends, such as nationality, language, or age.

Netizens who share the same interests could comment and make small talks with the poster, therefore, establishing good relationships.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"It is suggested that the youth of today had better take their time for cultural activities such as music and theater than sports. But personally, I do not agree with this statement, for me young people should learn to balance time for their cultural and physical activities because both types of activities are very importance to them.
First of all, it cannot be denied that in addition to the abiliti to help young people entertain and relieve stress, cultural activities also have powerful educational and inspirational values. Thanks to music, literature and some other cultural heritages which are preserved through generations and exchanged between different countries, young people can learn more about their history and origin, thereby form pride in the nation and the identity that they represent. Not only that, the freedom to accost and experience the cultural activities of other countries, can promote youth to have a broader view of equality, cultural diversity, and ethnic diversity. Moreover, cultural activities in general also have a big role in nurturing young people's souls, forging their faith, hope, creativity, willpower, morality and love. Although more than 20 years have passed, anti-war song "" Heal the world "" by Michael Jackson is still really valid and influential in educating generations about the importance of love and peace.

Furthermore, regular doing exercise is also a great way to reduce stress and improve mental health. Not only that, but young people can also develop many skills and qualities such as teamwork, communication skills, will to face and overcome challenges through sports training.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","There is a growing tendency for citizens to go shopping on the outskirts, which has led to central town stores' bankruptcy and a rise in the number of car consumption in some nations. Whilst this phenomenon is advantageous in a few aspects, the shortcomings are more serious than the benefits.
On the one hand, there are a few merits of acquiring products in out-of-town stores. Since the supermarkets located in the suburbs may have lower operating expenses, customers can be provided with high-quality products at competitive prices. For instance, citizens can buy organic fruit or vegetables at reasonable prices on the outskirts compared to those in the central town. Furthermore, going shopping in out-of-town shops may cement the relationship between inhabitants living in suburbs and those in the center of the town. Therefore, this can facilitate development and economic activities in distant places, which promotes the living standards of people in these areas.
On the other hand, there are several significant drawbacks that far outweigh the benefits. Traveling to the outskirts may require a higher cost of transportation.

While some people believe that governments should impose a prohibition on extreme sports, there are more compelling grounds why individuals have the right to participate in any activities.
There are several reasons to believe that risky activities should be strictly prohibited by governments. The primary reason is that the responsibility of guaranteeing the safety of citizens falls on administrations which means governments need to deter their residents from fatal consequences of hazardous sports. Obviously, if people take part in life-threatening activities, they will certainly be prone to unexpected accidents or even cope with inevitable death. For example, numerous athletes have to suffer from serve repercussions that stem from freefalling or malfunction of the engine. Another significant reason is that it is able to mitigate the financial burden for governments. To elucidate, the fewer patients with sports injuries, the less budget is allocated for medicine. According to a survey produced in 2015, for instance, the number of victims from dangerous sports increased by 25% compared to the previous year in the Us.
However, there is stronger evidence that people have the autonomy to do whatever they want.

Furthermore, studying various environments can provide people with knowledges that assist them in finding solutions to climate change and contamination.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The overuse of technology devices such as computers and cell phones as a method of communication has become a matter of considerable public concern because of its negative impact on the capability of reading and writing of the youth today. In my view, I totally agree that digital communication could cause numerous serious consequences.
The most essential explanation for my opinion is the habits of using informal language online which is disadvantageous for the young people's vocabulistics in reading and writing. Whereas, in study and workplace environments, they need to behave in a polite and professional manner through proper words. On computers and mobile phones, there are various apps and tools that attract many users because of their convenience and time saving. However, such well-designed inventions is prefered in chat rather than in formal expressions which need being carefully selective about language. A typical illustration of this is that the youth's frequent usage of icons in messages causes their shortage of capability of using language in reading and writing.
Another reason for my agreement with the idea is the dependence of the young on technological support. The assistance of spell-check apps such as grammarly or the suggesting words on email on computer and mobile phone, for example, will be beneficial to the user if they use it properly. However, many people overuse the tools for a long time, they depend on them and neglect rules of grammar and spelling which are necessary to both writing and reading skills. Consequently, these skills may erode steadily and be negatively affected.

While some people believe that this kind of activity should be prohibited by the government, there are more persuasive reasons why citizens have the right to participate in the activities they like.
On the one hand, there are some reasons to believe that authority should forbid risky sports. The primary reason is that this kind of activity may cause serious injuries to people's physical health. A broken leg, for example, will make it difficult for people to move and do heavy work for a long time, so their quality of life seems to decrease. Another significant reason is that some violent extreme sports can influence the thoughts and behaviors of viewers, especially young children. A clear example of this is boxing, which encourages the aggressiveness of young people and may lead to school fights between students.
On the other hand, there is stronger evidence that people should have the autonomy to play whatever they want. This is mainly because extreme sports can help players release stress effectively, especially the adventurous ones; consequently, they will enhance productivity at work and in life. In addition to this, due to the development of technology, there are now many essential devices to protect those involved in high-risk activities. For instance, when people go parachuting, there will be some equipment such as safety ropes and helmets to guarantee the safety of players.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the advent of computers and mobile phones, people, especially young ones, mostly use social networks to communicate, instead of newspapers, radio or letters like before. Despite the convenience these digital devices bring, there are concerns about if they have a negative impact on youngsters' literacy skills. This essay will argue that these fears have come true.
To start with, using social sites worsens young people's reading skills. This is because these sites continually load new content, which tends to be very short, to keep users' eyes on them for as long as possible. For example, the average length of a video on Tiktok-a popular social media platform, is about 23 seconds. That means people would grow accustomed to sustaining their attention towards one information source for a very little time before switching to another source. As a result, people tend to read more quickly and superficially. The ability to think critically about the content might thus be affected, which could lead to youngsters' poor reading skills.
The intensive use of computer-mediated communications has also adversely influenced young adults' writing skills. The reason is that the language used in chat rooms and online forums does not pay much attention to grammar and includes many slangs and abbreviations. Therefore, many young Internet users usually have poor control of syntax and spelling. Furthermore, young people often install applications such as Grammarly on their gadgets which help them to write correctly by using auto-correction tools, thereby making them oblivious about right and wrong words.

Discuss both views give opinions,"It is highly controversial that whether children should commence formal education at the age of seven or earlier. While early formal schooling for younger children is beneficial in a few aspects, school age starting from seven is an optimal choice due to its greater impacts on physical and mental developments of students in comparison with the earlier option.
On the one hand, there is a common belief that children should commence formal education from the early age. This is because being born in the era of remarkable social developments, these young generations are expected to become knowledgeable citizens in order to catch up with the times also create their own positions in the competitive job market. Therefore, parents are likely to believe that the earlier their children approach the educational information, the greater amount of knowledge they accumulate, which would effectively assist them in the future. However, it is scientifically proved that early childhood is an ideal period of shaping personality traits and emotional tendencies of children that underpin their sense of self and attitude to later learning, as well as their communicative skills and natural creativity. For this reason, holistic and balanced approach implemented by parents and educators should focus on consolidating children's internal learning processes, rather than achieving external goals, which indirectly put unnecessary pressure on young kids.
On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to commence formal learning at the age of seven. At this point, children have already been given a relatively adequate amount of time and space to develop their neuro-physiological, social and emotional capacities, which is a great precursor to the effective information acquisition and productive knowledge cultivation of children. Furthermore, the health status of children older than seven years old is virtually stable due to the fact that they are at lower risk of being infected by common diseases such as diarrhea or flu in comparison with their younger counterparts. As a result, they could continuously go to school with good physical condition, which is an essential factor that contributes to the better academic outcomes of students.

3901,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"It is widely assumed that a large number of young workers are not fully equipped with soft skills. This problem can be triggered by some causes. However, there are several approaches that can be taken to address this issue.
It is undoubted that the education system is primarily to blame for young employees' lack of interpersonal skills. As it currently places an overabundance of emphasis on academic subjects rather than fundamental soft skills, graduates are likely to be incapable of effectively cooperating and managing group projects. Additionally, the modern workplace's design may also be a factor in the problem. Particularly as an organization grows, employees are more likely to be assigned to their own cubicles and more specific parts of the work, which reduces their opportunities to exchange words.
However, certain remedies may be implemented to tackle the problem. Firstly, the present grading standards at universities must be modified to include more soft skill training. In addition to mandatory major-related studies, students should participate in seminars or classes focusing on job-related skills as well as extracurricular activities. All of these disciplines should also be counted against their overall graduation score to ensure they are well-equipped with the necessary soft skills. Moreover, it is suggested that more possibilities for contact among coworkers should be created. Instead of separate offices, it is preferable for businesses to have open workplaces where employees may connect with one another on a daily basis. There should also be collaborative initiatives on a company-wide scale, which will encourage colleagues to communicate more often.
To sum up everything that has been stated, the lack of basic interpersonal skills among young workers can result from the paucity of soft skills in the educational system and close working places.

But when alone, and especially in another country, people have to become more independent to be able to figure out how to solve their own problems.

Firstly, when domestic people's life is targeted as the government's major goal, the governments would not spend lots of money on other categories outside the countries.

For example, instead of aiding people in rural area oversea who are suffering with poverty, governments should use the budget to invest on some beneficial programmes or make some contracts with merits for their own citizens.

Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"It is a controversial topic whether people who turn out good after being in jail should give a talk to school students about the dangers of breaking the law. Although, it may not the best way educate students about these problems, it does have extremely convincing reasons why schools should conduct these talks.
Attending educational talks about the dangers of committing a crime given by ex-criminals may not be the best choice because there are more suitable approaches to this topic such as short films about crime and punishment. This approach gives students general information about crime and punishment which is necessary in the beginning stages of learning since students may not have basic knowledge about this topic. Moreover, animated films are an effective teaching tool because of its friendly approach. To be more specific, these educational films are created with their self-explanatory content and their motion graphic. Their straightforward content helps students to learn about crime and punishment more easily while their motion graphic makes lessons much more interesting to capture students' attention.
However, there are more compelling reasons why these talks should be held for school students to teach them about the dangers of committing a crime. This is firstly because ex-criminals used to break a law and come back from a prison, which means they have deep knowledge and personal experiences about this topic.

Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","Whether switching buying in out-of-town stores which lead to the increasing car demand is a controversial topic. While there are a few benefits to doing this, the shortcomings of this trend are more significant.
The increasing shoppers in out-of-town stores and using private transport is beneficial in a few ways. The main reason is that customers can be advantageous from reasonable prices since accommodation renting fees in out-of-town are often cheaper than corresponding fees in urban areas. Therefore, purchasers both experience spacious shopping zones and buy high-quality products at cheap cost, which simulates their buying preference. Besides, towards low-income people, they are likely to switch accommodation to rural areas to conveniently purchase and reduce transportation cost to stores. In terms of population distribution, it is a positive phenomenon when overpopulated pressure burden in cities can be addressed without any policies.
However, the drawbacks of the bankruptcy of small town-center shops and increasing number of cars are more considerable. From an environmental perspective, the increase of using private cars means a large amount of exhausted fumes released into the atmosphere, which contribute seriously to air pollution. If this situation is exacerbated, citizens have to suffer from several diseases related to respiratory diseases such as asthma, pneumonia and even lung cancer. Another disadvantage is that small town-center shops owners not only lose in revenues due to lack of customers and bankruptcy which possibly negatively impact on cities economy but also invest a considerable sum of money for relocating shops, if they go on business. That means shop owners have to change and enlarge their business operation, carrying out advertising activities to attract new shoppers instead of allocating money for other business purposes.

To begin with, it is a fact that the public usually has negative images to ex-prisoners, but not all of them have a bad personality.

Evidence show that many ex-prisioner are become normal people in society, Since they have suffered from the isolation and punishment, they can share their experience with teenagers and encourage them to abide by the laws and rules. To begin with, it is a fact that the public usually has negative images to ex-prisoners, but not all of them have a bad personality. As some prisons provide technical skill and personal development program to their prisoners, many of them have successfully followed these positive programs. These courses have changed their character and provided them with adequate skill, therefore, they were accepted back in the society. Many of them have learned their lessons during imprisonment, as they worked harder and became more successful than the regular people.. For example, Robert Downey; who known as Ironman. Before he become succesfully in his career, he has been in jail for 5 years because of drug and addicted. Morover, people who have been punished by the law would benefit from this agreement as well. They would feel better when they sharing they stories and this is a ideal way to stay away from crime for students. Educating students through stories and films can also be effective but they are not as much interactive as sessions with ex-prisoners.. In addition, this also a way to connect ex-prisoner to normal society when they just release from prison. In conlusion, we should educate children to stay away from crime and proganda them about the consequences of committing crime",1724,318,13,4.518867924528302,73,74,21,50,20
5732,3,Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that having these people give a talk to school students is the best way to tell them about the dangers of committing a crime. Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, many people believe that ex-prisoners would have changed themselves to be better citizens and these people are believed to be the greatest to educate the adolescent group about the negative effect of crime. I agree with this idea and will give my reasons below.
In my opinion, ex-offenders have real-life experiences, so their stories often attract the attention of teenagers. They can tell the adolescents how they get involved with crime, what life in prison is like, and how they suffer from it. Additionally, young people are more likely to accept the advice from people who are released from prison. As a result, their vivid and persuasive stories would help teenagers raise their awareness of the negative effects of comitting crime and become good citizens in the future.
In addition, ex-prisoners would benefit from this arrangement too. By sharing their stories, they could feel better and are glad for doing something great. Also, former prisoners would feel connected to society and become good mentors for teenagers because they had experienced the same situation before. Stories and films are great, but stories of an ex-offender are likely to have a powerful impact. With their guidance, I believe that many teenagers would improve themselves and become good citizens in the future.
To conclude, I agree that several people can be good citizens after they are released from prison, and they can be good advisors for teenagers. Also, I believe that students ca learn the consequences of committing crimes effectively from ex-prisoners.",0,"Nowadays, many people believe that ex-prisoners would have changed themselves to be better citizens and these people are believed to be the greatest to educate the adolescent group about the negative effect of crime.

Moreover, online games or chatting could distracts people from working and studying. Another problem is the lack of security. The internet can keeps most of your details such as passwords, your address, photos and other files. This means there is a chance that a hackers could steal and use your private information.

However, the Net also has advantages which are greater than the disadvantages. Firstly, it makes communication significantly more convenient. Nowadays, internet connects everyone even if they are geographically far from each others.

591,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"In the contemporary world, the young people have a tendency to know more about the popular headliners due to the effect of social media. However, it is not a positive trend as they have less information about historical people in their country. Regarding this problem, several suggestions can be put in practice so as to raise greater interest in history among the youth.
The root of this trend can be attributed to two certain elements. The first reason is that social media contributes to the increasing interest of the youth nowadays. As famous people usually appear via Facebook pages, Instagram accounts, online newspapers and furthermore, they tend to grab plenty of the youngsters' attention. The youth, consequently, would love to look up for the headliners' information in order to keep up with their social media feed. An additional element that leads the youth to know less about historical figures is the tedious teaching method of history at school. History itself is not considered attractive, and to spend periods listening to unfamiliar figures who belong to the past might draw less interest compared with reading about ubiquitous stars and events.
Besides, some remedies can be adopted so as to improve the situation. On a national level, the government should consider allocating more budgets for entertainers in order to make intriguing programs which help introduce historical events and people in this country to the youth. As these figures appear more frequently on the headlines or in the movies and music videos, young people will be encouraged to search about their background stories. In this way, they will gain greater knowledge about the past. On an educational level, the teaching method during history classes should be tailored in order to arouse students' curiosity. A suggestion is that these history classes include more interactive activities as well as vivid technological effects. It will help deliver the information in an expressive and appealing way.
To conclude, the youth nowadays tend to understand more about popular stars than historical famous people of their country.

While there are admittedly several benefits, I believe that the negative influences of this trend are more glaring.
There are some advantages of traveling to remote natural areas. First of all, the discovery of these locations helps the locals earn incomes from tourism activities. If these places are reached, the tourism industry will be expanded with attractive options for holidays or excursions due to the fact that those locations are usually appealing to travelers. As a result, new jobs can be created and economic benefits can be derived. Furthermore, people can experience different cultures or spectacular landscapes of these new places. For instance, Cao Bang Province is located in Northern Vietnam with beautiful geo-cultural sites.

However, I believe that the negative aspects of this trend are more significant. With the burgeoning tourism, distant natural places are opened to tourists and researchers resulting in the increasing number of hotels and commercial buildings to serve the demand of these people. This leads to possible damage to nature, such as massive deforestation or water contamination due to humans' lack of environmental awareness. In addition, the natural habitat is also in danger because humans can disturb wildlife by hunting them which leads to changes in wildlife's living patterns and the imbalance of the ecosystem.

3479,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Riding a bicycle has no longer been a common activity in today's society. There are several possible reasons for this social phenomenon but proper schemes can certainly be introduced to improve the situation.
Two main factors, in my opinion, are attributed to the unpopularity of using bicycles. First and foremost, the availability of modern means of transport, especially private cars could offer users with a more convenient and quicker choice than bicycle riding. It is obvious that when modern people are fully occupied with their work, bicycles has gradually been replaced by a faster car or bus ride. Another reason is that in many countries, there is a shortage of dedicated cycling lanes, which might cause a danger to cyclists. This means that those who ride bicycles may be at risk of colliding with other vehicles, which can lead to serious injuries or even fatalities.
However, this problem could be addressed if concerted effort is properly made by related authorities. The government can impose higher tax on fossil fuels as well as on cars and motorcycles. By adopting this policy, authorities are able to discourage the use of non-environmentally friendly modes of transport and encourage people to riding bicycles. Furthermore, more dedicated lanes should be built to serve bike-users. When lanes for bicycles are separated from other types of transport, cyclists are guarded against dangers, thus enjoying their pollution-free trips.

4649,11,Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"These days, technology is changing at an alarm rate in all categories especially the modern form of communication. It is believed that these form of communication has both negative and positive impact on people lives. I tend to agree with this opinion and I will support my view with essay.
With the birth of smartphone, laptop and other electronic products, interaction have never been so easy for people nowadays. You only need one phone, an internet network connection then you will be able to communicate and interact with all kind of people around the world without making any effort. But this method is slowly making people to reduce the amount of time seeing their friends. This has had a negative impact on their social lives. According to a recent survey by the Chinese media shows that out of 2500 survey participants, nearly 97% avoid outdoor activities because of fear, anxiety and boredom. Most of them said that they wanted to be alone, building relationship online and searching happiness inside the digital world. Not only the Chinese but also many other modern Asian societies choosing online interaction rather than meeting face to face. This will eventually leads to different kind of mentally illness like depression or phone addiction.
Even though there are a lot of negative impacts, but modern forms of communication still have its benefits. With the internet network being covered almost every corner of the world, you can easily connect and communicate with anyone whenever, wherever you want.

In conclusion, modern forms of communication has both negative and positive impact on people lives. Its depends on how we use and why we use it for. For me, the authorities should make some efforts on tighten the internet usage time to reduce the amount of time people use their phone.",0,"These days, technology is changing at an alarm rate in all categories especially the modern form of communication. It is believed that these form of communication has both negative and positive impact on people lives. I tend to agree with this opinion and I will support my view with essay. With the birth of smartphone, laptop and other electronic products, interaction have never been so easy for people nowadays. You only need one phone, an internet network connection then you will be able to communicate and interact with all kind of people around the world without making any effort. But this method is slowly making people to reduce the amount of time seeing their friends. This has had a negative impact on their social lives. According to a recent survey by the Chinese media shows that out of 2500 survey participants, nearly 97% avoid outdoor activities because of fear, anxiety and boredom. Most of them said that they wanted to be alone, building relationship online and searching happiness inside the digital world. Not only the Chinese but also many other modern Asian societies choosing online interaction rather than meeting face to face. This will eventually leads to different kind of mentally illness like depression or phone addiction. Even though there are a lot of negative impacts, but modern forms of communication still have its benefits. With the internet network being covered almost every corner of the world, you can easily connect and communicate with anyone whenever, wherever you want. You could also use this method to contact friends that haven't talked or met for a period of time. In conclusion, modern forms of communication has both negative and positive impact on people lives. Its depends on how we use and why we use it for.

3975,9,Young people should spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theater and less time on sport. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"Nowadays, cultural activities like music and theater need to be spent more time by young people instead of time on sport. In my opinion, I agree that cultural activities should have more time in young people's life. However, I believe that we could not reduce the time for sport because sport is always necessary for people's healthy life.
On the one hand, I see cultural activities could make young people relax after stressful working time. For example, playing guitar or piano helps us to be more exciting, or attending theater with funny plays could reduce stress and raise more positive energy. Music and theater also give us more knowledge about sociology and history. For instance, some traditional music or history content in the theater could make young people easy to understand history of their country and make them more interested in learning history. Many real life stories are brought to music and theater, which makes young people could get many life experiences.
On the other hand, we should not spend less time on sport, because sport makes young people keep fit. Some young people often eat quick snacks because they do not have much time to cook. So they will become overweight or even be obese. Playing sport every single day would help young people get a fitness body and feel more confident. We could also prevent many diseases if we spend more time on sport. Nowadays young people allocate much time to sit with the computer which is very bad for their back, neck, and eyes. Only half or one hour per day to do jogging or workout could help to get rid of many diseases related to back, neck and eyes. Finally, sport makes young people more energizer for the next day. After a long day, every stress will disappear if we do yoga for about thirty minutes. Or if you do some workout in the morning, that will help you more concentrated for work and study on that day.
In conclusion, young people should spend more time on cultural activities such as music and theater, but do not spend less time on sport. In my view, we could reduce time on many things without sport like surfing the internet, hanging out with friends, etc... Health is the essential thing in our life and sport is the best way for young people get a healthy life.",0,"Nowadays, cultural activities like music and theater need to be spent more time by young people instead of time on sport.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","Thanks to the advancement of technology, people nowadays can visit a host of places that they could not before, including isolated places. While some people believe that taking trips to those areas is disadvantageous, there is a more compelling belief that this development can bring us some benefits.
On the one hand, traveling to these areas might have some drawbacks since it can be relatively expensive and sometimes challenging. This is firstly because if people travel to remote areas such as the South Pole, they are not only required to purchase appropriate clothes such as fur coats and travel boots, but they might also have to have a health check-up to prepare for their trips. For example, in Vietnam, although people recently have had access to a lot of caves, they still ask their participants to be mentally and physically healthy and those trips sometimes cost a large amount of money due to its rareness.
On the other hand, there is a more persuasive argument that this development can be beneficial since many people want to have this exotic experience. First and foremost, these places can be more captivating compared to some other tourist attractions that numerous visitors flock to. In addition to this, people attending those trips might have a sense of achievement as not many people have the opportunity to go to these spots. Some Youtubers in Vietnam, for instance, stated that they prefer making videos of the isolated areas and places that are off the beaten track.

Do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, the proportion of youth generation who have comitted a crime is getting increasingly. While some people believe that the school student should be educated by giving them a talk from wrong-doers, I believe that this action might bring some drawbacks which is more significant then its benefits.
On the one hand, it is truth that the speed from law-breaker have given some certain powers as it draw on practical experience. Since adolesent are reluctant to recieve advice from adults, such a talk can help them to realize how serious it is if they take part in unlawful activities.

5622,16,Some people believe that young people know about international pop and movie stars but know very little about famous people from the history in their own country. Why is this? How can more interest be created in young people to gain more knowledge about their own famous people from history?,"In the present times, many young people have more knowledge about the world's pop singers or famous foreign actors than famous figures belonging to the history of their own country.. There are many reasons for these problems and we should also take different measures to help the young people of our country know more about our country's historical heroes.
There are many reasons why young people know more about foreign celebrities than about the country's historical hero. The first is due to the way that the information of historical figures, such as documentaries or books, is quite boring and uninteresting and excites young people with interesting things and catch up with what's happening in the movies that famous foreign stars are currently having on the internet or in theaters. Our nation's historical heroes can only be seen during boring history lessons at school or through holidays where young people care only about how long they get off and don't pay attention to why they have these holidays.
To solve this problem, we should upgrade documentaries or history textbooks in schools, documentaries will use more modern graphics or history textbooks has more illustrations and is more interesting than just text and words. Thus, it will be interesting to today's young people and make them somewhat remember the historical heroes of our country more than famous foreign singers and actors.

What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"The adverse impacts of workers being inadequately equipped with communication skills are a major topic of concern in today's world. This alarming trend is caused by the inappropriate way of teaching at school, at home and the growing peer pressure. It must be addressed by a number of definite actions, which include adding more practical, teamwork assignments and launching campaigns to change parents' mindset about academic learning.
The issue of employees falling short of basic soft skills could be ascribed to several causes. The most obvious reasons is the inaccurate focus of tertiary education. Most of what curriculum covers throughout school focuses on academic information, there are few opportunities for students to develop cognitive life skills. The primary purpose of high school is to prepare students for the higher education but the fact that after graduation, pupils also have to perform in the real-world situations tend to be ignored. However, the essence of this issue is the demand of parents, who always insist on their children passing the tests with flying colors. They put pressure on schools, hence, teachers are forced focus on theories lessons to make sure that a high rate of students can get into the top-tier universities or colleges. In addition, the peer pressure is increasing faster than ever before, the lectures are reported to be much harder than in the past but several academic information cannot be implemented at work. Thus, the adolescents have to spend more time on learning to catch up with friends and the society, consequently, they are likely to neglect social-skill development.
A number of solutions could be adopted to tackle the lack of interpersonal skills of employees. The primary solution is to implement more homework and lessons featured teamwork and practical examples at school. For example, dividing the class into sectors working on the same topic has been proved to be effective in improving students' collaborative performances and communication skills. There, they can learn how to cooperate with others to produce the most prominent outcome or to meet the deadline. Another solution is that schools can hold parental meetings about the importance of interpersonal skills in businesses and the true value of academic lessons.

As a result, the burden on schools and students are both reduced, pupils would have more time and energy to make progress in terms of soft skills such as cooperative skill.

From my point of view, the drawbacks of this trend are greater than its benefits.
On the one hand, there is no denying that the Internet brought to people a much more convenient way of keeping information.

As a result, people without cars have limited access to out-of town stores, and it may result in an increase in the use of cars. Do you think the disadvantages of this change outweigh its advantages?","In some nations around the world, people have a tendency to go to supermarkets on the outskirts due to the fact that small shops in the city centres cannot compete with these large stores and are on the verge of close-down. This leads to an increase of using cars and a limitation for people without cars to access with these stores. This trend would have more disadvantages than advantages.
On the one hand, there are significant benefits to the situation. The primary one is that more people shopping at the out-of-town stores can effectively stimulate the economy or tourism in this area. Therefore, more job opportunities would be created in these fields, which could not only decrease the unemployment rate but also minimize the growing burden of the population in the city. Another crucial advantage is that the preference of wholesale stores would foster the development of the automotive industry. This is because people who have not owned a motor vehicle have to buy one, especially a car in order to move to the suburbs, which has a positive impact on this industry.

As a result, the level of air pollution will increase, which causes more individuals to suffer from respiratory diseases such as asthma and pneumonia. Moreover, the default of small stores in the town would make these owners whose store is their greatest asset struggle in debt.

2908,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent years, the unpopularity of bicycles has evolved into a major topic of concern. This trend could be attributed to several reasons and some definite measures should be adopted to persuade citizens to use bicycles more frequently.
There are several reasons why people hesitate to choose bicycles as a form of transport. The first reason is that people tend to be over-reliant on cars which are well-equipped with air conditions, Uv protection glasses, and soft seats as well. This means of transport provides users with a comfortable and convenient experience because they could no longer worry about the bad weather and smog. In addition to this, in many countries, there is a shortage of dedicated cycling lanes which leaves cyclists at the risk of severe injuries or even fatal consequences. In Vietnam, for instance, there are over 10,000 traffic accidents with approximately 25% mortality rate due to running in the same lane of bicycles and heavy vehicles, recorded from the Traffic Safety News in 2019.
A number of solutions could be adopted to tackle the problems associated with the diminishing of bicycle usage rate. The primary solution is that the government could conduct monthly green days that require people to cycle to work. In the long term, these days not only contribute to environmental protection but also help citizens to form a good habit of cycling daily. Another solution is that the authorities should put a tax on motorbikes and use this budget for the construction of cycling paths. As a result, once a network of cycling lanes is well-developed, inhabitants might choose a bicycle as the preferred model of transport.

It is predicted that unless these remedies are implemented, the problems associated with using less bicycles will continue to persist in the future.",1980,354,14,4.677966101694915,86,99,29,53,14
446,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In the modern world, bicycle is no longer the widely-used means of transport. The reasons for this situation are related to the blooming of other transports, also the bike thief. It must be addressed by some solutions such as the campaign of riding, the heavy tax for modern forms of transport and arrange more bike parking
From my point of view, the decrease in the number of bicycle users derives from two main reasons. The first one is that as the living standard has been raised, the new means of transport, which are much more convenient, were invented such as motorbike, car or subway. In busting life, people do not want to waste too much time and energy on road so the appearance of new transports can adapt their demand. The moderner the new one is, the faster the old one be substituded. Therefore, the bicycle becomes unpopular day by day. Besides that, the huge amount of bicycle lost in the past is also a reason for the uncommon of this kind of transport. Compare to other transport, bicycle is smaller, light, easier to be lift up and be stolen. Moreover, the bicycle park is not supervised carefully so people gradually do not buy bicycle anymore.
A number of action could be done to tackle this situation. The primary solution is that the government should encourage the riding campaign more. They could open some bike racing for citizen to raise the knowledge about the advantage of riding for our health and environment. Moreover, the government could enact the update in tax policy for motorbike and car which use fossil fuel and realease toxic fume. The money from this can be spent to build more bike parking and security for the bicycle in the road.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"People in the modern era are less likely to use bicycle as means of transportation. This trend boils down to the growth of other vehicles and further distances travelling. It can be addressed by some definite actions, including creating cycle lanes and raising awareness of children to increase the number of people using bicyles
This trend is caused by a number of reasons. A major one is that the development of other means of transport, such as motobike and cars widen people's choices when it come to transportation. They can carry more people and things, which is more convenient. When going on holiday, for example, families usually carry loads of luggage along so they tend to choose a car rather than a bike. Another factor is that people these days tend to travel more, and bicycles are not the optimal choices when travelling long distances as it requires much effort to ride. It is also quite dangerous to use a bicycle when riding though some remoted areas so people do not use them to travel as much as they did in the past.
Some solutions can be implemented to increase the use of bicyles among inhabitants. More cycle lanes should be built around the city to help people ride safely in the road as it is often dangerous to travel the same lanes with other vehicles and can easily cause accidents. In addition to this, it is advisable to raise awareness of people, espeically young children and the elderly who do not have to travel a lot about the benefits of riding a bike to their physical health and the environment so that they can take it into consideration and switch their present vehicle into a bike.

5650,0,"Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Dangerous sports are popular activities with the youth in today's world to satisfy the feeling of adventure and passion for speed or altitude. While some believe that extreme sports should be forbidden, there are more reasonable grounds that people have allowances to practice any sports.
There is a common belief that banning dangerous sports is more beneficial in ensuring the safety of players. The primary reason is that extreme sports are often performed in dangerous places or require high-risk movements; therefore, there is so much potential endangerment that causes serious injuries and accidents although players have experienced and professional skills. For example, Base Jumping, which is a sport variation of skydiving that players jump from tall buildings, bridges, and cliffs, caused the death of over 6,000 people while playing. Another significant reason is that people who have accidents while participating in extreme sports are mostly young. It leads to a lack of potential young human resources, which causes a negative influence on the government.
However, there is a stronger evidence that the government should make conditions for the development of extreme sports. This is mainly because dangerous sports improve physical and mental health. Extreme sports help players recognize and express many emotions, such as fear or anxiety, which is help them relieve moods and frustrations in life. Through that, players get over their nerves and more confident. In addition to this, people who participate in dangerous sports receive an extraordinary feeling that everyday activities cannot bring when they conquer and admire natural wonders. Besides the benefit to mental health, dangerous sports also improve physical health since these sports require physically-demanding and specific skills that players can promote their ability to feel well-being.
In conclusion, although it is often believed that governments should shoulder the responsibility of underestimating the risks of dangerous sports by banning them, there are more compelling reasons why individuals should have the freedom to do any kind of sport. It is recommended that individuals should consider the dangers, equip suitable equipment, and ensure safe conditions before participating in extreme sports.",0,"Dangerous sports are popular activities with the youth in today's world to satisfy the feeling of adventure and passion for speed or altitude.

What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"It is true that bicycles are not a first choice for everyone as a form of transport nowadays. Resulting from a number of reasons, this situation should be solved by attracting humans in some practical ways.
There are two reasons why people use bicycles less as a form of transport. One reason is that bicycles are not convenient since traffic jams now happen frequently.

Besides, the distance between home and company is usually far away and if people ride bicycles to work, they have to get up early in order to prepare as well as avoid the intense heat.

What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"In recent years, it is a common situation in workplaces that newly-employed members of staff possess insufficient collaboration abilities. This phenomenon is due to the cloistered lifestyle among the young generation and an unfriendly working environment towards newcomers, and could only be alleviated by conscientious selection in the recruitment phase, or by encouraging efficient communication in the office.
Lack of interindividual skills in recruits generally stems from several aspects of the contemporary world. One typical precursor is the enclosure in the youngsters' way of life in the era of social media, which has disconnected them from the outer world and gradually diminish their sociability. As a result, those young people would face difficulties delegating tasks and prefer to work in isolation. Another possible catalyst is the unwelcoming attitude of several veterans in workplaces towards beginners, which usually springs from the mindset of desiring domination and respect. However, this is conducive to the recruits' fear to cooperate and communicate with colleagues in the long term.
To mitigate this situation, certain measures would need to be implemented. A necessary remedy is that businesses would have to attract and select the suitable type of employees who meet the prerequisites of interpersonal skillsets in that office. This could be achieved by attentively undertaking the recruitment phase, with the job description being detailed to candidates and the employers having appropriate measures to apprehend their communicability. Another solution is to promote goodwill and inclination to maintain effective conversations and relationships with co-workers.

However, many people claim that the widespread use of technological devices such as phones and computers negatively affects people's reading and writing skills. From my point of view, I totally agree with that.
The primary reason is that most technological devices such as laptops and phones are equipped with software as well as language support functions with the aim of making users' lives easier. However, this sometimes makes people dependent and since then they become limited in reading and writing skills such as the recording function when people want to find or look up anything is the reason why people's writing skills are limited. Apart from this, communicating and connecting through media or apps, for instance facebook, zalo, gmail can cause people to form a habit of using slang or some abbreviations. This leads to a loss of control over grammar and sentences, making it difficult for people, especially the younger generation, to give presentations in class or prepare reports for agencies.

But in this technological era, it is achievable for those who study natural science and like traveling to come to these places. Whereas this development has several benefits, I believe that the drawbacks of it are far weightier
On the one hand, a few positive aspects are arising from this trend of traveling to isolated natural places. This is first because if such a trend is adopted, tourists will not only have a chance to travel to other cities or countries but also explore and discover new places like the North Pole or the South Pole. This means that they can gain more valuable experience when immersing themselves in nature. In addition to this, when visiting remote areas, more knowledge about the natural habitat might be acquired by people especially researchers and scientists. Polar bears, for example, can learn more about their lives and the ways they survive in the North Pole where is far away from human
On the other hand, exploring remote areas is associated with many shortcomings which far outweigh the benefits. One crucial reason is that unaware activities of humans can do detrimental damage to the natural habitat like throwing litter. For instance, because of not having any restaurants or street vendors in these places, travelers need to bring canned food to eat, and as a result, they will throw it like their habit.

People who are staying overseas have to face certain difficulties. Firstly, these people will have to deal with loneliness. Because most expatriates live independently and alone, they are unable to get help from their families in bad situations. Secondly, people who choose to live in another country need to adapt to new social rules. In Japan, slurping, usually when eating noodles or soup, is a sign of appreciation for the chef, while in other countries, this is considered rude. The louder the slurp, the greater the thanks.
Besides the disadvantages of living abroad, there are 2 main advantages. Firstly, people who work or study in other nations tend to be able to use a foreign language fluently.

Secondly, studying in developed countries provides access to modern technology and extensive knowledge; therefore, there are more opportunities for employment.

1251,24,Some businesses find that their new employees lack basic interpersonal skills such as cooperative skill. What are the causes and suggest possible solutions?,"In today's society, the shortage of fundamental interpersonal skills among newly-hired staff has been a contentious issue. This problem may be attributed to the theoretical teaching methods at universities and the way work is distributed to staff. It must be tackled by some definite solutions which include altering how work is allocated for employees and encouraging students to participate in practical projects during their school years.
To begin with, the scarcity of soft skills may arise from some major causes. The primary reason is that tertiary education tends to place more emphasis on theoretical subjects, which leave little room for students to apply their knowledge into reality. As a result, a large portion of fresh graduates are unable to communicate and collaborate with their colleagues in an effective way despite being equipped with extensive expertise. Another significant cause could be the influence of how the companies operate. In many businesses, work is likely to be distributed separately for individuals to complete on their own. Employees, therefore, do not have the opportunities to discuss with their colleagues in order to exchange knowledge and broaden their horizons.
Companies and universities, hence, should adopt some strong measures to address this problem. The most effective solution could be increasing the real-life experience of the undergraduates. This can be achieved by the provision of clubs, projects and competitions in the universities. Participating in these practical activities will give students the chance to develop various interpersonal skills such as team-working, leadership and time management. In addition, companies should adjust the way work is allocated for employees. Instead of working individually, projects can be organized in a group-oriented way, which maximizes the interactions and cooperations between staff.
In conclusion, the teaching method at universities and the way work is allocated are the two major driving forces behind the shortage of new employees' interpersonal skills. It is predicted that unless strong measures, including providing more practical activities for students and adjusting the allocation of work are adopted, the problem will still continue in the future.",0,"In today's society, the shortage of fundamental interpersonal skills among newly-hired staff has been a contentious issue.

The primary reason is that tertiary education tends to place more emphasis on theoretical subjects, which leave little room for students to apply their knowledge into reality. As a result, a large portion of fresh graduates are unable to communicate and collaborate with their colleagues in an effective way despite being equipped with extensive expertise. Another significant cause could be the influence of how the companies operate. In many businesses, work is likely to be distributed separately for individuals to complete on their own. Employees, therefore, do not have the opportunities to discuss with their colleagues in order to exchange knowledge and broaden their horizons. Companies and universities, hence, should adopt some strong measures to address this problem. The most effective solution could be increasing the real-life experience of the undergraduates. This can be achieved by the provision of clubs, projects and competitions in the universities. Participating in these practical activities will give students the chance to develop various interpersonal skills such as team-working, leadership and time management. In addition, companies should adjust the way work is allocated for employees. Instead of working individually, projects can be organized in a group-oriented way, which maximizes the interactions and cooperations between staff. In conclusion, the teaching method at universities and the way work is allocated are the two major driving forces behind the shortage of new employees' interpersonal skills. It is predicted that unless strong measures, including providing more practical activities for students and adjusting the allocation of work are adopted, the problem will still continue in the future.",2259,373,17,5.1554959785522785,99,97,37,64,8
7100,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Using bicycle as a frequent means of transport nowadays is a contentious issue of modern society. This phenomenon might pose threats to our living environment and should be addressed by some definite measures.
On the one hand, because of the pace of modern life, it is unfeasible for citizens to use bicycle as a frequent vehicle in the daily basis. To be more specific, they have to balance between work and other aspects of life such as solving some hectic schedules and taking care of their family members. Therefore, it is essential for dwellers to use the fossil fuel-based vehicles instead of bicycles to save time spending on commuting. Another cause could be that there is no longer safe when residents commute in the urban area. To explain, it is inevitable that citizens would go through some major roads or highways to commute to their workplaces so that this creates difficulties for cyclists, especially for those who live in the large cities.
A number of solutions could be adopted to tackle the problems associated with encouraging people to use green vehicles. The primary approach is enhancing the environment consciousness of inhabitants. Particularly, the authority should organize some environmental campaigns to simulate dwellers to use eco-friendly vehicles and educate students on the importance of environment protection via using bicycles. Besides, it is the responsibility of the government to renovate the transport infrastructure to ensure the safe for cyclists. There should have the construction of lanes which are exclusive for green vehicles, this is safer for citizens and they might use bicycles as the efficient means of transport in the near future.
In conclusion, using bicycles has not become popular recently because it is inconvenient and may be unsafe for users. Therefore, the proper remedies should be adopted to tackle this situation. It is recommended that there should have some public campaigns which are relative to protecting environment so as to enhance citizens' awareness.",0,"Using bicycle as a frequent means of transport nowadays is a contentious issue of modern society.

On top of that, using children as an advertising target makes children more likely to have wrong ideas and thoughts. In fact, children are the generation that does not have a thorough and thorough view of everything around, rather, they are not fully equipped with the knowledge to make accurate judgments and are not experienced enough to distinguish what is good for themselves. As a results, with their innocence, it is very easy for them to put their faith in eye-catching advertisements and Pr programs, whether it is good for them or not. And this will sometimes lead to health problems for children, for example, advertising some junk food on Tv may make children like them more and more motivated to develop that interest because of vivid advertising images although it is a fact that junk food is something that can cause a lot of diseases to people if consumed in excess.
Another point worth noting is children's mental health can have negative effects if they are exposed to too many advertisements that they feel are relevant to them. In fact, ad campaigns aimed at children are mostly quite interesting, vivid and eye-catching ads and undeniably their strong appeal to children in general. This can lead to children being easily addicted to watching ads and this is easy to harm their eyes because children's eyes are quite sensitive and prone to eye diseases if they are exposed to a lot of phone and Tv screens. Moreover, they easily form the desire to have the things that appear in the ads, thereby causing possessiveness, even disturbing their parents to get what they want.
In conclusion, government should minimize advertising plans aimed at children.

It can be attributed to a few factors including the lack of training and the inexperience due to the previous working environment. These issues should be addressed by some actions such as providing proper training and changing the working way.
Lack of proper training is the primary reason for new employees' interpersonal skills deficiency. Team working is now not a curriculum in most schools so that students must research themself if they want to learn about it. However, the majority seems not keen on this problem and they will probably spend time entertaining and studying other issues except for interpersonal skills. Moreover, office workers in almost all companies are required to work individually in separate spaces and support from colleagues are unnecessary. It means that the opportunity to collaborate with others is very small, which will lead to a shortage of interpersonal skills.
A number of solutions should be adopted by companies to address the problem of interpersonal skills deficiency. Training courses with little or no fees for this type of skill should be provided to the employees. The courses should be obligatory for people that cannot coordinate well with their colleagues for the purpose of improving businesses productivity. Furthermore, businesses can create a working environment where employees must collaborate to complete the tasks. Working as a team for a long period will increase their interpersonal skills as well as the opportunities for colleagues interaction.
In conclusion, the lack of proper training and an unsuitable working environment are the two main causes of interpersonal skills deficiency.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Communicating via high-tech products is nowadays commonly used. There are compelling reasons why this usage of phones and computers might be detrimental to the youngsters's reading and writing ability such as how they actually read and write through those devices and their preferred activities.

There are some reasons that people hesitate to choose bicycle as their form of transport. The most particular reason is overdependence on modern vehicles such as motorbikes and cars.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","People have different views about dangerous and safe sports. Although there are good arguments in favor of prohibiting some extreme sports, I think that people should be allowed to play any dangerous sports.
Advocates of prohibiting dangerous sports may argue that players always face life-threatening perils and involve a high level of potential risks when taking part in these sports. In other words, participants would be susceptible to serious injuries, wounds, fatal outcomes, or even death if equipment meets any malfunction. Equipment failures in some extreme sports such as skydiving, motor racing, and parachuting render players more vulnerable than in others. Scuba divers, as a specific example, may experience panic attacks, breathing difficulties, and decompression sickness, leading to fatality and a decline in the general heath of sports participants.
On the other hand, I think that people have the freedom to play any sport regardless of the dangers. Since it is such a matter of individual liberties, it is quite unreasonable and nonsense for government to prevent citizens from pursuing their passion when people have fully acknowledged the threads. Obviously, these extreme sports do not take a toll on society, or the environment, and other people and individuals should have the autonomy to opt for them. Adrenaline junkies seek pleasure, excitement, and novelty when engaging in dangerous sports. Moreover, every sport carries a certain degree of risk so the government cannot ban any sports based on their dangers. In recent days, the painstaking preparation of any extreme sports with more high-quality facilities and specialized gear is made to reduce the chance of mortality. Players also need to undergo appropriate training and pass a certificate course if they wish to play extreme sports solo.
In conclusion, while some hold the view that the government would ban these dangerous sports because of the risks involved, I strongly believe that individuals have the right to choose any sports to play.

4103,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"Although there are more environmental benefits that commuters can reap when using bicycles, not many people prefer this means of transport. This essay will discuss the causes behind its unpopularity and then offer some feasible solutions to it.
The reasons so few people choose to travel by bike are varied, two of which are the availability of other modern vehicles and the potential accidents one might encounter when cycling. Regarding the former, commuting by these vehicles does not requires people to engage in as many physical activities as riding a bicycle. Therefore, people saves a great deal of energy that may be allocated to deal with heavy workload. As far as the second idea is concerned, some governments do not invest money in traffic infrastructure upgrades, including the construction of bicycle paths, which necessitates cyclists to use the same path with other automobiles. This can act as a deterrent to people's interest in cycling due to their worry about safety.
However, local authorities can play a pivotal role in promoting the usage of bicycles. Chief among these is that they should impose a high tax on automobile purchase, which may discourage citizens from possessing such vehicles. As a result, people can rely on bicycles as a better alternative. Another measure worth mentioning is that the councils can raise funds to improve traffic systems and build up cycle paths. If this program is well adopted, the risk of accidents can be alleviated, thereby resulting in a increase in the number of people riding a bike.
In conclusion, I think several reasons can be given to explain the low usage of bicycles.

Apparently, the overwhelming attention towards current public figures in comparision to that of historical legends is understandable.

Climbing mountain is unsafe sport but it is an excercise for muscles, and help people to be brave and confident. They want to climb on the top of the moutains to see the beauty of nature like fresh air or significant sightseeing. Another reason why government should not ban is human right. , people can do anything without having any trouble with others. In the Usa, young people can play dangerous sports or activities freedomly as long as not involve to others. In conclusion, governments should not ban dangerous sports or activities. Instead of that, they can propose some laws for unsafe sports like except only people who over 18 years old can join.",1636,308,18,4.425324675324675,62,79,23,43,19
1146,1,Nowadays people use bicycles less as a form of transport. Why is this the case? What can we do to encourage people to use bicycles more?,"In recent years, many countries have witnessed a significant reduction in using bicycles as a form of transport. This is conducive to various reasons, in which the slow speed as well as the weariness while biking and traffic injuries are the most notable causes. However, these difficulties can be tackled by separating lanes for bicycles and promoting health benefits of biking.
One of the most _ x0008_adverse impacts of riding bicycles is the slow speed as well as the exhaustion. To some people, it is essential to show on time at the office, and start a day full of energy. For this reason, most workers and students would prefer taking a bus, a train or using cars in order to stay productive. Traffic injuries and fatalities also act as a catalyst for the reduction in using bicycles as a form of transport. On the roads, cars and other engined transportations undoubtedly travel at a higher speed than bicycles, which is even more alarming since many governments stay ignorant to the needs of separating road lanes for biking. As a result, serious accidents can be caused considering bikes are more fragile and riders have a higher chance of being directly exposed to danger.
Although biking remains to carry various drawbacks, a number of solutions can be adopted to encourage people to use bicycles more. By promoting health campaigns to raise awareness on the benefits of riding bikes, the government can convince people to use them more for the purpose of transportation. In addition, to avoid traffic accidents and ensure rights for bikers, it is recommended that separated lanes for bicycles be implemented. Restriction on using cars and providing bike parking lots can encourage people to use bicycles more.
In conclusion, the decrease in using bicycles as a form of transport can derive from numerous reasons. Vital measures, such as raising awareness and implementing bike lanes, need to be adopted to handle this situation and encourage people to ride more. It is predicted that unless these solutions are taken, bikes will be completely replaced by other auto transportations in the near future.",0,"In recent years, many countries have witnessed a significant reduction in using bicycles as a form of transport.

4678,7,"These days, more and more people are going to other countries for significant periods of time, either to find a job or to study. There are clearly many benefits to doing this, but people who live abroad can also face some difficulties. Do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages?","It is true that people are increasingly moving overseas in order to work or further their education, especially young people. In my opinion, this trend could have both benefits and drawbacks that need to be considered.
One of the primary motivations for moving abroad is that people want to participate in high-quality academic environments and leading industries. Many renowned universities, which are located in developed countries such as the Usa or European countries, strongly attract students to come and join their programs, particularly Master's and Ph. D. programs. Big corporations in a variety of areas also attract talents from all over the world to come to work. Secondly, moving abroad may bring people lots of valuable experiences. Nowadays, young people seem to like movement that encourages them to travel and enjoy different cultures. Moreover, broadening their network by making friends everywhere may bring new opportunities and support their personal development.
Turning to the other side of the argument, culture shock is a significant issue. Differences in language or food can make it difficult for people to live in a new community. This often results in homesickness and feelings of loneliness, especially for introverts. Another difficulty is that people are not always fully protected in foreign countries. What I mean by this is that it is usually more troublesome for foreigners when they get sick, are involved in an accident, or have legal issues. This can make people scared.
In conclusion, the increase in moving overseas will have both pros and cons.
